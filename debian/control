Description: Jifty perl libraries
 Yet another web framework.
 .
 What's cool about Jifty? (Buzzwords)
 .
 DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
        Jifty tries not to make you say things more than once.
 .
 Full-stack
        Out of the proverbial box, Jifty comes with one way to do everything
        you should need to do: One database mapper, one templating system,
        one web services layer, one AJAX toolkit, one set of handlers for
        standalone or FastCGI servers. We work hard to make all the bits
        play well together, so you don't have to.
 .
 Continuations
        With Jifty, it's easy to let the user go off and do something else,
        like fill out a wizard, look something up in the help system or go
        twiddle their preferences and come right back to where they were.
 .
 Form-based dispatch
        This is one of the things that Jifty does that we've not seen
        anywhere else. Jifty owns your form rendering and processing. This
        means you never need to write form handling logic. All you say is "I
        want an input for this argument here" and Jifty takes care of the
        rest. (Even autocomplete and validation)
 .
 A Pony
        Jifty is the only web application framework that comes with a pony.
 .
 This package provides Jifty scripts.
