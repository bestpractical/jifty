Jifty::Manual::Tutorial - Zero to Jifty in a Jiffy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This tutorial should give you everything you need to 
build your first application with Jifty.

=cut

=head1 HOW TO

=head2 The requirements

Here's what you need to have installed -- at least when we write it.

=head2 Installing Jifty

No bones about it. We believe pretty strongly in the DRY (Don't Repeat
Yourself) principle. That's one of the big reasons we love Perl and
CPAN. Jifty makes use of lots of amazing code from CPAN.  At last count,
it directly depended on 60 packages from CPAN.  Most of these libraries
are cross-platform pure-Perl packages and should run great out of the
box on any platform you can get Perl onto.

We've gone to lengths to make sure you don't spend your day downloading
library after library by bundling everything we can inside the Jifty
package.  With luck, all you'll need to install is a few tricky libraries
that actually need to be compiled for your operating system. (Little
things like Perl's database interface and the embedded SQLite that Jifty
defaults to.)

You can either grab a complete Jifty package from http://download.jifty.org/pub/jifty/
or install from CPAN. If you get the I<slim> version from CPAN, you'll have
to install Jifty's dependencies yourself. (Though we help out with that 
where we can.)  If you want to get up and running quickly, grab the latest
version from:

    http://download.jifty.org/pub/jifty/

Either way, the installation process is the same:

  # tar xzvf jifty-<version>.tgz
  # cd jifty-<version>
  # perl Makefile.PL
  # make
  # make test
  # make install

If the tests don't pass, we want to hear about it. Please join us
on C<jifty-devel@lists.jifty.org> and report the failure. (See 
L</GETTING HELP> below for info on how to join the list.)

=head2 Setting up the Scaffolding

Once you have Jifty happily installed, you're ready to 
create your first application. 

Jifty is intentionally a bit minimalist. All you I<really>
need to make an application go is a copy of the F<jifty> commandline
tool (inside your new application's F<bin/> directory.  

Of course, it's often helpful to have a bit more structure around to
help guide your work. Jifty comes with tools to build that structure for
you.

Change directory to some place it will be safe to create a new
Jifty application. (Jifty will create a subdirectory for you).

  # jifty app --name MyWeblog
  Can't guess application root from current path (/your/current/directory) or bin path (/usr/bin)
  Creating new application MyWeblog
  Creating directory lib
  Creating directory lib/MyWeblog
  Creating directory bin
  Creating directory etc
  Creating directory doc
  Creating directory log
  Creating directory web
  Creating directory web/templates
  Creating directory web/static
  Creating directory lib/MyWeblog/Model
  Creating directory lib/MyWeblog/Action
  Creating directory t
  Creating configuration file MyWeblog/etc/config.yml

Let's take those one by one.

=over

=item bin

Inside F<bin/> is F<jifty>, the Jifty command dispatcher. Some
of the most important commands are C<schema>, which sets up or updates
your database schema and C<server>, which starts a standalone
webserver. To find out what commands your F<jifty> comes with, run:

    jifty help

=item etc

Configuration files live in F<etc/>, though if you don't have a config
file, Jifty will supply some sane defaults.

=item doc

Jifty won't magically write your documentation for you, but when B<you>
write your docs, put them in F<doc/>.

=item log

Jifty uses L<Log::Log4perl> to configure its logging. By default, it
dumps logs named F<server.log> and F<error.log> into the F<log> directory.

=item web/templates

Jifty uses L<HTML::Mason> as its primary templating system.  Put
your application's templates into F<web/templates/>.  Out of the
box, Jifty comes with an application I<skeleton> that it installs in
F<share/web/templates/>.  This default application is
a convenient way to get a basic application up and running quickly,
but probably needs some customization as you build a more advanced
application.

You can find where Perl stuck Jifty's default templates with:

  perl -MJifty::Util -e 'print Jifty::Util->share_root'

=item web/static

Some nontrivial percentage of the I<stuff> your web application serves
out doesn't need to (or I<shouldn't>) pass through your templating
engine.

Just drop your static files into F<web/static/> and Jifty will serve
them out if it can't find a template with the right name.

Out of the box, Jifty comes with a CSS style, Javascript libraries and
a Pony. Look in F</usr/local/share/jifty/web/static>.

=item lib/MyWeblog

For a full treatment of the Jifty object model see
L<Jifty::Manual::ObjectModel>.

To build a basic Jifty application, you only need to worry about two
sorts of classes, B<Models> and B<Actions>.

=item lib/MyWeblog/Model

The real base of your application lives in
C<lib/B<ApplicationName>/Model>. Classes here define your application's data
structures and how they relate to each other.  Jifty will use your model
classes to set up and upgrade your database's schema when it needs to.

=item lib/MyWeblog/Action

When we said you only need to worry about B<Models> and B<Actions>,
we weren't telling the whole truth.  Jifty will take care of basic
database-interaction (C<CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE>) B<Actions> for
your B<Models>, but they're there if you want to change anything.

=item t

Jifty starts off your application with a basic harness, but can't yet write 
all your tests for you. (It does, however, build simple tests for model
classes you generate.)

=back

=head2 Building your data model

As you might imagine by the fact that this tutorial application is named
B<MyWeblog>, the example here is a simple weblog application.  Future
tutorials will add authentication, comments, and RSS and Atom feeds.

=head3 Posts

Weblogs tend to center around posts, so it's no surprise that the first model
to create is the C<post>:

  # cd MyWeblog
  # jifty model --name Post
  Writing file /tmp/MyWeblog/t/00-model-Post.t
  Writing file /tmp/MyWeblog/lib/MyWeblog/Model/Post.pm

Great! Now you have a B<Post> model (not that it models anything yet).

Open F<lib/MyWeblog/Model/Post.pm> in your favorite text editor.

You should see something like this:

  use strict;
  use warnings;

  package MyWeblog::Model::Post;
  use Jifty::DBI::Schema;

  use MyWeblog::Record schema {

  };

  # Your model-specific methods go here.

  1;

Now it's time to tell the model class about posts. Start by giving our post a
C<body> and a C<title>. (In a future tutorial, the application will become fully
folksonomy-compliant by adding a C<category> and upgrading that C<category> to a
C<tags> table.)

Position your cursor right after:

  use MyWeblog::Record schema {

Add the lines:

  column title =>
        type is 'text',
        label is 'Title',
        default is 'Untitled post';

  column body => 
        type is 'text',
        label is 'Content',
        render_as 'Textarea';

Save your model class.

=head2 Setting up the database

Ok. It's time to initialize MyWeblog's database. By default, Jifty sets up your
application with the SQLite database engine.  If you'd rather use PostgreSQL or
MySQL, you need to add some content to F<etc/jifty.yml>. (See C<Jifty::Config>
for a bit more information).

  # jifty schema --setup
  INFO - Generating SQL for application MyWeblog...
  INFO - Using MyWeblog::Model::Post
  INFO - Using Jifty::Model::Session
  INFO - Using Jifty::Model::Metadata
  INFO - Set up version v0.0.1, jifty version 0.605070

=head2 Starting the Jifty application server

Ok. You have a working, if simplistic, application.  Start up a webserver and
have a look around.  Be sure to check out the AJAX-enabled administrative UI,
the online documentation browser, and the Pony.

  # ./bin/jifty server
  INFO - You can connect to your server at http://localhost:8888/

=head2 Building a user interface

The administrative web does give you everything you need to work with your
application's data, but it's not much of a weblog.

=head3 Posting

Create a page to post a new weblog entry:

  # cd share/web/templates/

Open a new file called F<post> in your text editor. Make it look like this:

  <%init>
  my $action = Jifty->web->new_action(class =>'CreatePost');
  </%init>

  <&|/_elements/wrapper, title => "Post to your weblog" &>
  <% Jifty->web->form->start() %>
  <% Jifty->web->form->next_page( url => '/') %>
  <% $action->form_field('title') %>
  <% $action->form_field('body') %>
  <% Jifty->web->form->submit( label => 'Post' ) %>
  <% Jifty->web->form->end() %>
  </&>

=head3 Viewing

It's really easy to get a I<basic> listing of entries and a little bit more
complex to get a pretty AJAXified paged list.  Here's how to do both; you can
decide which one works best for you.

(If you cut and paste the code in the examples below, make sure it's 
lined up in column 1, or it won't work.)

=head4 The quick and dirty way

Open a new file called F<index.html> in the F<share/web/templates> directory
in your text editor. (Your webserver will
treat the URL C</index.html> as the I<default> page for your site).  Make it
look like this:

  <%init>
  my $posts = MyWeblog::Model::PostCollection->new();
  $posts->unlimit();
  </%init>

  <&|/_elements/wrapper, title => Jifty->config->framework('ApplicationName') &>
  <dl>
  % while (my $post = $posts->next) {
   <dt><%$post->title%></dt>
   <dd><%$post->body%></dd>
  % }
  </dl>
  </&>


=head4 The complex way that gets you lots of cool toys

The I<complex way> involves using one of Jifty's advanced features: I<Page
regions>. These regions let your application reload page sections
independently, either using AJAX on modern high-end browsers or regular GET
requests with downlevel browsers such as C<lynx>, C<w3m>, or the browser on
your mobile phone.

The downside of this approach is that each separate region needs to live in
its own I<fragment> file.

The complex way starts off about the same as the easy way.  Open a new file
called F<share/web/templates/index.html> in your text editor.  Fill it with this:

  <&|/_elements/wrapper, title => Jifty->config->framework('ApplicationName') &>

  <% Jifty->web->region(name => "myweblog-posts",
                        path => "/fragments/page_of_posts") %>
  </&>

If you're on the ball, you've probably already guessed that you need to create
a file called F<share/web/templates/fragments/page_of_posts> containing:

  <%args>
  $page => 1
  </%args>
  <%init>
  my $posts = MyWeblog::Model::PostCollection->new();
  $posts->unlimit();
  $posts->set_page_info( current_page => $page,
                         per_page     => 25
                       );
  $m->out("No items found.") if ($posts->pager->total_entries == 0);

  </%init>
  % if ($posts->pager->last_page > 1) {
     Page <% $page %> of <% $posts->pager->last_page %>
  % }
  <dl class="list">
  % while (my $post = $posts->next) {
   <dt><%$post->title%></dt>
   <dd><%$post->body%></dd>
  % }
  </dl>

  % if ($posts->pager->previous_page) {
    <% Jifty->web->link( label => "Previous Page", onclick => { args => { page => $posts->pager->previous_page } } ) %>
  % }
  % if ($posts->pager->next_page) {
    <% Jifty->web->link( label => "Next Page", onclick => { args => { page => $posts->pager->next_page } } ) %>
  % }

Now fire up your Jifty webserver again. Go create a post by browsing C</post>
on your webserver.

=head3 Hey, where'd that class come from?

If you're paying attention, you may have wondered about C<MyWeblog::Model::PostCollection>,
since there's no file called F<PostCollection.pm>. By default, Jifty uses 
C<Jifty::ClassLoader> to auto-generate a bunch of classes for you. Of course,
you can override these definitions if you like. See L<Jifty::ClassLoader> for more details.

=head2 Navigation

Of course, having to remember the URL to get to the posting page is a bit
annoying.  To get a B<Post> button in the menu, you need to override the default
menus.

Jifty's I<default> menus live in F<_elements/nav> in the default application
template (along with the Pony).  For now, override F<_elements/nav>. (We're
working on ways to make this better.)

Inside your applications F<share/web/templates> directory, create a directory called
F<_elements>.

  mkdir share/web/templates/_elements

You may want to start with the stock jifty template, in which case you
only need to add the C<< $top->child( Post... >> part

  cat $(perl -MJifty::Util -e 'print Jifty::Util->share_root' \
    )/web/templates/_elements/nav > share/web/templates/_elements/nav

Otherwise, inside F<_elements>, open up a new file called C<nav> in your
text editor and insert:

  <%init>
  my $top = Jifty->web->navigation;
  $top->child( Home => url => "/");
  $top->child( Post => url => "/post", 
                       label => "Post Article");
  </%init>

For more information about the menu system, see the documentation in
L<Jifty::Web::Menu>.

=head2 That's it!

That's just about everything you need to get started building Jifty
applications.  We're working hard to make Jifty even easier to use and
to obsolete the I<hard bits> of this tutorial as quickly as we can.

Please join us on the C<jifty-devel> mailing list to talk about how you're 
using Jifty or what you find difficult or hard to use about it.

=head1 GETTING HELP

=head2 Online Help

The C<jifty> command-line application comes with builtin help.

  jifty help

  jifty help <command>

If your server is running with administration mode enabled (the
configuration file C<AdminMode> setting is missing or non-zero), you can
click the "Online Docs" link in your browser for an extensive list of
per-module Jifty documentation.

=head2 Joining the mailing list

C<jifty-devel@lists.jifty.org> is where we discuss how we're building Jifty,
what we're having trouble with and so on.

To join the list, send mail to C<jifty-devel-subscribe@lists.jifty.org>.

=head2 Browsing the wiki

We have a wiki! (Actually, the wiki is Jifty's primary website)

Please visit L<http://jifty.org/>, browse and contribute.

The wiki is powered by I<Wifty>, a Wiki built on Jifty. Its code is freely 
available from the jifty subversion repository.
