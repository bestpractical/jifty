jQueryMigrationGuide - How to migrate your code to use jQuery.

=head1 Migrate your jifty app to jquery

Application developers may start the migration by modifying
F<config.yml>, set the C<ConfigFileVersion> to 4. If you did not write
any custom javascript code for your app, then its done. Everything
should just work.

If you did wrote some javascript code before, but you did not use any
of those funcitons defined in F<jifty*.js>, F<prototype.js> or
F<scriptaculous.js>, then you're still good to go.

Otherwise, your code might need to be modified a little bit. Since
both F<prototype.js> and F<scriptaculous.js> are removed by default,
one trivial choice is to simply bring them back. That is as easy as
adding a B<Prototypism> plugin to your Jifty application.

If you dislike the whole Prototypism like us, you can choose to
re-write your code with jQuery. In the section L</"From Prototype
to jQuery"> below, we provide some known pattern that can be applied to
rewrite prototypism code with jQuery, or with just normal javascript.

If you hack Jifty internal, please make sure you've read the following
L</"Jifty API"> section and L<Jifty::Manual::JavaScript> to catch the
Javascript API update since the removal of C<prototype.js>.

Although we've removed C<prototype.js>, we still prefer to use
non-conflict mode of jQuery at this moment. That is, C<$> function is
now undefined, but not an alias of jQuery. This is to ensure that it's
not conflicting with Prototypism at all conditions. If you'd like
to use C<$> function, create that alias in your C<app.js> like this:

    $ = jQuery;

However, instead of making a global alias, it's always recommended to
localize this alias within a closure:

    (function($) {
        // $ is an alias to jQuery only inside this closure

        $(".message").show();
    })(jQuery);

=head1 Jifty API

Jifty javascript libraries embraced a major re-architect after jQuery
landed. Especially those internal functions to process form elements.

The Prototype-based old way is to extend Form object and the
Form.Element object. Since the removal of Prototype library, it is
dangerous to name those functions under Form. Because loading
Prototype library can destroy those Jifty functions.

The new jQuery-fashioned way is to always extend internal functions
under Jifty object. C<Form> becomes C<Jifty.Form>, C<Form.Element> becomes
C<Jifty.Form.Element>, and so on. The detail list of these defined
functions are given in L<Jifty::Manual::Javascript>. Most of
those functions are internal functions that you probably should not
use them directly.

=head1 From Prototype to jQuery

If you've ever written javascript code on your Jifty applications, and
you'd like to remove PrototypeJS library, here are some dummy rules to
re-write prototypejs-based javascript code with jQuery.

=head3 Array iteration

From:

    A.each( function( $_ ) { ... } )

To:

    jQuery.each(A, function(index, value ) {
        // "this" is an alias to current value.
    })

=head2 Hash key iteration

From:

    H = new Hash({...});

    H.each(function( pair ) {
        // pair.key is the key
        // pair.value is the value
    });

jQuery.each is designed to work on both C<Array> and C<Object> in the
same way. So there's not much difference.

To:

    // H can be any kind of "Object"

    jQuery.each(H, function(key, value) {
        // "this" is an alias to current value.
    })

=head2 Object extend

From:

    obj.extend({ ... }}

To:

    jQuery.extend( obj, { ... } )

=head2 JSON

jQuery does not build-in with JSON stringify function, but since it
neither altered the native Array, nor defined its own Hash, it's
prefered and fine to just use C<JSON.stringify> from C<json.js>.

From:

    // obj need to be one of those objects defined in C<prototype.js>
    obj.toJSON();

To:

    JSON.stringify( obj )

=head2 Effects

jQuery has a small set of default effects built-in to its core. They
have different naming then those defined in C<scriptaculous.js>. The
internal way to do effect is via the C<Jifty.Effect> method. Please
see the detail usage in L<Jifty::Manual::JavaScript>.
