=head1 GLOSSARY

We use words.  This is what they mean.

=over 4

=item action

An B<action> is a specifically designed RPC call that can do something to the
system.  An action takes any number of L</argument>s, which it
L</canonicalize>s, L</validate>s, and then uses to do something useful.  Each
action has a L</result>.  See L<Jifty::Action> and L<Jifty::Manual::Actions>.

=item active

For an L</action> to run, it needs to be B<active>.  Most of the time, all
actions submitted are active, but it is possible to specify only a specific
action as active; any non-active actions are ignored.  See L<Jifty::Request>.

=item AJAX

An acronym standing for B<Asynchronous Javascript And XML>.  Though technically
incorrect, it is the buzzword that describes doing asynchronous requests to the
server while the user waits.  This can lead to very "dynamic" pages, as the
browser does not need to refresh the entire page to update a small section of
the screen.  In Jifty, the sections of the screen are called L</region>s.  See
L<Jifty::Web::PageRegion>.

=item argument

An B<argument> is a named parameter to an L</action>.  Jifty generally renders
these on the screen as L</form field>s.  See L<Jifty::Action>.

=item canonicalize

To turn an L</argument> into a more standard form.  For instance, a
canonicalizer could translate a user-typed date into a date object or a
SQL-formatted date string.  See L<Jifty::Action>.

=item constructor

A property of an L</argument>; the action B<must> have a value submitted for
this argument in order to be constructed.  This is different from
L</mandatory>, in that the user can leave mandatory fields empty.  For
instance, the C<id> of a L<Jifty::Action::Record::Update> is a constructor.
See L<Jifty::Action>.

=item continuation

A concept stolen from Lisp, Scheme, Smalltalk, and Perl 6.  The continuation of
any particular piece of code is the deferred operations that care about the
return value at that point.  In the context of Jifty, a continuation is a
deferred L</request> that may pull L</argument>s and the like from the
L</result>s of the current request.  Continuations can be arbitrarily nested,
so they are often useful to keep track of tangents that the user went on.  See
L<Jifty::Continuation>.

=item form field

A widget which the browser renders.  These are generally useful to ask the user
for a value for a L</argument> to an L</action>.  See
L<Jifty::Web::Form::Field>.

=item fragment

A section of HTML contained in a L</region>.  Fragments are a kind of
standalone Mason component which the browser can request individually.  Because
of this, they can only take strings and scalars as arguments, not references or
objects!

=item mandatory

A property of an L</argument>; the user must enter a value for the action to
validate.  This is the simplest level of L<validation|/validate>.

=item moniker

Every instance of a L<Jifty::Action> has a B<moniker>.  A moniker is
an arbitrary-length nonempty string containing no semicolons.
Monikers serve as identifiers for actions, to associate arguments with
actions and to access specific actions "by name".  Monikers need not
be globally unique, but they must be unique within a single request.
Monikers have no semantic meaning. See L<Jifty::Action/monikers>

=item region

An area of the page which JavaScript can replace.  The content in the region is
a L</fragment>.  Think of the region as the box and the fragment as the content
in the box.  See L<Jifty::PageRegion>.

=item request

A single query which lists L</action>s to run, together with a page or list of
L</fragment>s to return.  This most often comes from the browser as query
parameters, but may come from other sources as a L<JSON> or L<YAML> POST
request.  The answer to a request is a L</response>.  See L<Jifty::Request>.

=item response

The answer to a L</request>, it contains a L</result> for every action that
ran.  See L<Jifty::Response>.

=item result

The answer to a L</action>, it contains information about if the action was a
success or failure, and further detail about why or how.  It can also contain
arbitrary "content".  See L<Jifty::Result>.

=item sticky

A property of L</form field>s.  If a field is "sticky," values that the user
entered appear there again when the page is rendered again, avoiding making the
user type them again.  Most L</action>s have form fields which are sticky on
failure, so the user can update the information and try again.

=item validate

To check that the provided value of a L</argument> is a possible value for it
to have.  See L<Jifty::Web::Form::Field>.
