=head1 NAME

Jifty::Manual::Actions - Doing Stuff With Jifty

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Jifty::Action> abstracts around the idea of taking named inputs
(L<"arguments"|Jifty::Manual::Glossary/argument>), doing something
with them, and returning some result to the user. If this sounds
incredibly general, that's because it is -- actions do nearly
B<everything> in Jifty.

C<Jifty::Action> will also generate HTML for you for its arguments --
no more manually writing C<< <input> >> tags and extracting GET and
POST arguments by hand and dispatching them where they belong --
C<Jifty::Action>> does it all for you.

=head2 WRITING ACTIONS

Jifty provides some actions for you out of the box -- see
L<Jifty::Manual::ObjectModel> and L<Jifty::Action::Record> for
autogenerated actions, as well as L<Jifty::Action::Redirect>, but any
non-trivial application will want to define actions of its own. This
is how you do it.

Every action is a subclass of Jifty::Action, as well as typically
I<AppName>::Action. Actions usually live in the I<AppName>::Action::
namespace; While that's just convention, it will make your life easier
if you follow it.

This, the simplest possible action is:

    use warnings;
    use strict;

    package MyApp::Action::DoNothing;
    use base qw/MyApp::Action Jifty::Action/;

    1;

(Instead of copying-and-pasting that, or typing it in, though, you
could just run:

    jifty action --name DoNothing

in your application's directory, and Jifty would create a skeleton for
you. )

However, if you want to actually do something with your actions, you
need to define two things: their L<arguments|/arguments>, and a
L</take_action> method.

=head2 arguments

Every C<Jifty::Action> subclass should define a C<sub arguments> that
returns a hashref describing what arguments it takes. Supposing we
were writing a an action to post a blog article, we might start out
with arguments like thus:


    sub arguments {
        my $self = shift;
        return { title    => {},
                 category => {},
                 body     => {} };
    }

However, we've only scratched the surface of the power the
C<arguments> API offers. Arguments (can) have types, labels,
validators, canonicalizers, and even more. To start with, lets add
some types and labels:

    sub arguments {
        my $self = shift;
        return {
            title    => {
                label     => "Title",
                length    => 50,
                mandatory => 1,
            },
            category => {
                label     => "Category",
                length    => 30,
               },
            body     => {
                label     => "Entry",
                render_as => 'Textarea',
               }
        };
    }

Now, we can ask the action to render form fields, and it will know how
to display them. But, we can do even better. Let's improve the look of
that C<category> field, by making it a combobox (a combination
dropdown/text field), with some default values available:

   ...
   category => {
            label            => "Category",
            render_as        => "Combobox",
            available_values => ["Personal", "Work", "Blog"]
        },
   ...

But a static list is lame. What we really want is a C<Category> model,
and to keep track of all the categories users have entered:

    ...
    my $categories = MyBlog::Model::CategoryCollection->new();
    $categories->unlimit;

    ...
        category => {
            label            => "Category",
            render_as        => "Select",
            available_values => [
                {
                    display_from => 'name',
                    value_from   => 'name',
                    collection   => $categories
                }
            ]
        },
    ...

Now, Jifty will populate the combox with the result of calling C<name>
on each element on C<$categories>. Alternatively, if you set
C<value_from => 'id'>, Jifty would automatically return the C<id> of
the category, for easy database reference. We don't do this with the
combobox, however, since a combobox displays the selected value in its
text field.

See L<Jifty::Action> and L<Jifty::Web::Form::Field> for more fields
you can set in the returned C<arguments> hash.

=head3 validation

C<Jifty::Action> can automatically validate arguments for you, as
appropriate. If an argument has C<valid_values>, then C<Jifty::Action>
will automatically verify that the given value matches one of
them. However, you can also write your own validators. Just write a
C<< sub validate_<argument> >>, and it will be called as appropriate:

    use Regexp::Common 'profanity_us';

    sub validate_body {
       my $self = shift;
       my $body = shift;
       if ( $body =~ /$RE{profanity}/i) {
           return $self->validation_error( body => 'Would you speak like that in front of your mother? *cough*');
       }
       return $self->validation_ok('body');
    }

You can also do validation in the model -- see
L<Jifty::Action::Record> 

Note that if, instead of failing, you want to automatically modify
invalid content to be valid, you want a
L<canonicalizer|Jifty::Manual::Glossary/canonicalize>, not a
validator.

Additionally, if you set C<ajax_validates> or C<ajax_canonicalizes> to
true for an argument, then Jifty will automatically validate or
canonicalize it in an L<AJAX|Jifty::Manual::Glossary/ajax>-enabled
browser when the user stops typing.

=head2 take_action

Once an action has arguments, it needs to do something with them. An
action does so in its C<take_action> sub, which will be called when an
action is submitted, and only if its arguments
L<validate|/validation>. 

Inside C<sub take_action>, subclasses can access their arguments via
C<$self->argument_value('foo')>. If you need to check whether you've
been passed an argument or not (as opposed to being passed a true
argument or not), use C<$self->has_argument('foo')>.

Once an action has done its thing, it needs to inform the caller
whether or not it has succeeded, possibly with some status message. To
this end, every C<Jifty::Action> has a C<Jifty::Result> associated
with. C<Jifty::Result>> carries both a failure/sucess code, and a
textual message describing the result of running the action.

Thus, if your action failed for some reason, you would, in
C<take_action>, write code like:

    $self->result->error('Couldn't write blog post');
    return;

If, however, the action completed successfully, you might write:

    $self->result->message('Posted to your blog');

Actions will default to successful with an empty message if you don't
do anything. Additionally, if you need to return more semantic
information than a simple message, you can set arbitrary content on
the result, using $self->result->content, e.g:

    $self->result->content( id => $new_post->id);

This information can be then used elsewhere to, for example,
automatically redirect you to a view page for that new blog post. See
L<Jifty::Request::Mapper> for some more information.

=head2 USING ACTIONS

At their simplest, you can create and run actions yourself, e.g.:

    Jifty->web->new_action(
        class     => 'PostBlogEntry',
        arguments => {
            title    => 'A boring blog entry',
            category => 'Jifty',
            body     => 'This blog entry is lame.'
        }
    )->run;

Note that Jifty->web->new_action, and all similar methods
(e.g. L<Jifty::Request::add_action|Jifty::Request/add_action>,
L<Jifty::Web::Form::add_action|Jifty::Web::Form/new_action>), will
automatically qualify the C<class> with either C<Jifty::Action::> or
C<I<AppName>::Action::> as necessary (I told you putting actions in
I<AppName::Action::> would make your life easier!)

In practice, you'll rarely provide actions with arguments
yourself. Instead, you'll create an action with no or partial
arguments, often in the L<dispatcher|Jifty::Dispatcher>, or a Mason
component's C<< <%init%> >> block (See L</constructor arguments> for
details about passing arguments to actions on creation).

    my $create = Jifty->web->new_action(
        class   => 'PostBlogEntry',
        moniker => 'post_blog'
    );

Having created the action, you will, in one of your Mason components,
output a form where the user can fill in the action's arguments:

    <% Jifty->web->form->start %>
    <div class="post-metadata">
      <% $create->form_field('title') %>
      <% $create->form_field('category') %>
    </div>
      <% $create->form_field('body') %>
    <% Jifty->web->form->submit(label => "Post") %>
    %# or <% Jifty->web->form->link(label => "Post", submit => # $create) %>
    %# or <% $action->button(label => "Post"); %>
    <% Jifty->web->form->end %>

C<form_field> will render the field, along with the C<label> as an
HTML C<< <input> >> tag that Jifty knows how to interpret to feed back
to your action as an argument when the form is submitted. If you need
to change the appearance of the field, Jifty outputs classes on the
fields, as well as providing some semantic C<< <div> >>s you can style
using CSS. (TODO: Document Jifty HTML classes and default CSS).

See L<Jifty::Web::Form/submit>, L<Jifty::Web/link> and
L<Jifty::Action/button> for details on the different ways to generate
a submit button.

Additionally, instead of C<form_field>, you can use C<hidden> to
generate a C<hidden> input, which will not be viewable or editable in
a web browser. (Note that a knowledgeable user *can* still submit a
form with a different value for that hidden input; If this concerns
you, make sure you have appropriate
L<ACLs|Jifty::Manual::AccessControl> in place. If it still worries
you, you probably want a L<continuation|Jifty::Continuation>.

=head3 monikers

You probably noticed the C<< moniker => 'post_blog' >>. Every action you
create in Jifty has an associated
L<moniker|Jifty::Manual::Glossary>. A C<moniker> is simply a unique
identifier for the action (unique per request, which in practice
typically means per HTML page). Since actions are constantly being
serialized (over HTTP, or Javascript AJAX calls, and so on), and
unpacked, we need a way refer to specific actions other than just
object identity, e.g. to extract its arguments or results in the
C<dispatcher|Jifty::Dispatcher>. Monikers give us that. Given a
moniker, you can pull information about the associated action out of a
L<request|Jifty::Request> or L<response|Jifty::Response>.

If a moniker is unspecified, it will be autogenerated.

(XXX TODO Note about action registration here)

=head3 Argument Folding

If you write out more than one C<form_field> for a given argument in
the same form, and more than one is filled in, Jifty will C<fold> the
arguments into an array before filling them in to the action. This
provides a way to do, e.g. a C<BulkEdit> action that applies some set
of changes to many records at once.

(XXX TODO Note about C<constructor> arguments)

=head1 ACTIONS AS WEB SERVICES

Your actions are also automatically published as web services.
Clients can POST requsets, usually using the YAML or JSON request
format.  See C<bin/service> for a trivial generic webservice client.

(XXX TODO More about webservices)
