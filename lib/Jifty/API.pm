=head1 NAME

Jifty::API - Manages and allow reflection on the Jifty::Actions that
make up a Jifty application's API

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # Find the full name of an action
 my $class = Jifty->api->qualify('SomeAction');

 # New users cannot run some actions
 if (Jifty->web->current_user->age < 18) {
     Jifty->api->deny(qr/Vote|PurchaseTobacco/);
 }

 # Some users cannot even see some actions
 if (Jifty->web->current_user->id > 10) {
     Jifty->api->hide('Foo');
     Jifty->api->show('FooBar');
     Jifty->api->hide('FooBarDeleteTheWorld');
 }

 # Fetch the class names of all actions
 my @actions = Jifty->api->all_actions;

 # Fetch the class names of all the allowed actions
 my @allowed = Jifty->api->actions;

 # Fetch all of the visible actions (some of which may not be allowed)
 my @visible = Jifty->api->visible_actions;

 # Check to see if an action is allowed
 if (Jifty->api->is_allowed('TrueFooBar')) {
     # do something...
 }

 # Check to see if an action is visible
 if (Jifty->api->is_visible('SpamOurUsers')) {
     SpamBot->be_annoying;
 }

 # Undo all allow/deny/restrict/hide calls
 Jifty->api->reset;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You can fetch an instance of this class by calling L<Jifty/api> in
your application. This object can be used to examine the actions
available within your application and manage access to those actions.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a new C<Jifty::API> object.

Don't use this, see L<Jifty/api> to access a reference to
C<Jifty::API> in your application.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $self  = bless {}, $class;

    # Setup the basic allow/deny rules
    $self->reset;

    # Find all the actions for the API reference (available at __actions)
    Jifty::Module::Pluggable->import(
        search_path => [
            Jifty->app_class("Action"),
            "Jifty::Action",
            map {ref($_)."::Action"} Jifty->plugins,
        ],
        except   => qr/\.#/,
        sub_name => "__actions"
    );

    return ($self);
}

=head2 qualify ACTIONNAME

Returns the fully qualified package name for the given provided
action.  If the C<ACTIONNAME> starts with C<Jifty::> or
C<ApplicationClass::Action>, simply returns the given name; otherwise,
it prefixes it with the C<ApplicationClass::Action>.

=cut

sub qualify {
    my $self   = shift;
    my $action = shift;

    # Get the application class name
    my $base_path = Jifty->config->framework('ApplicationClass');

    # Return the class now if it's already fully qualified
    return $action
        if ($action =~ /^Jifty::/
        or $action =~ /^\Q$base_path\E::/);

    # Otherwise qualify it
    return $base_path . "::Action::" . $action;
}

=head2 reset

Resets which actions are allowed to the defaults; that is, all of the
application's actions, L<Jifty::Action::AboutMe>,
L<Jifty::Action::Autocomplete>, and L<Jifty::Action::Redirect> are allowed and
visible; everything else is denied and hidden. See L</restrict> for the details
of how limits are processed.

=cut

sub reset {
    my $self = shift;

    # Set up defaults
    my $app_actions = Jifty->app_class("Action");

    # These are the default action limits
    $self->action_limits(
        [
            { deny => 1,  hide => 1, restriction => qr/.*/ },
            { allow => 1, show => 1, restriction => qr/^\Q$app_actions\E/ },
            { deny => 1,  hide => 1, restriction => qr/^\Q$app_actions\E::Record::(Create|Delete|Execute|Search|Update)$/ },
            { allow => 1, show => 1, restriction => 'Jifty::Action::AboutMe' },
            { allow => 1, show => 1, restriction => 'Jifty::Action::Autocomplete' },
            { allow => 1, show => 1, restriction => 'Jifty::Action::Redirect' },
        ]
    );
}

=head2 deny_for_get

Denies all actions except L<Jifty::Action::AboutMe>,
L<Jifty::Action::Autocomplete> and L<Jifty::Action::Redirect>. This is to
protect against a common cross-site scripting hole. In your C<before>
dispatcher rules, you can whitelist actions that are known to be read-only.

This is called automatically during any C<GET> request.

=cut

sub deny_for_get {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->deny(qr/.*/);
    $self->allow("Jifty::Action::AboutMe");
    $self->allow("Jifty::Action::Autocomplete");
    $self->allow("Jifty::Action::Redirect");
}

=head2 allow RESTRICTIONS

Takes a list of strings or regular expressions, and adds them in order
to the list of limits for the purposes of L</is_allowed>.  See
L</restrict> for the details of how limits are processed.

Allowing actions also L</show> them.

=cut

sub allow {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->restrict( allow => @_ );
}

=head2 deny RESTRICTIONS

Takes a list of strings or regular expressions, and adds them in order
to the list of limits for the purposes of L</is_allowed>.  See
L</restrict> for the details of how limits are processed.

=cut

sub deny {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->restrict( deny => @_ );
}

=head2 hide RESTRICTIONS

Takes a list of strings or regular expressions, and adds them in order
to the list of limits for the purposes of L</is_visible>.  See
L</restrict> for the details of how limits are processed.

Hiding actions also L</deny> them.

=cut

sub hide {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->restrict( hide => @_ );
}

=head2 show RESTRICTIONS

Takes a list of strings or regular expressions, and adds them in order
to the list of limits for the purposes of L</is_visible>.  See
L</restrict> for the details of how limits are processed.

=cut

sub show {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->restrict( show => @_ );
}

=head2 restrict POLARITY RESTRICTIONS

Method that L</allow>, L</deny>, L</hide>, and L</show> call internally;
I<POLARITY> is one of C<allow>, C<deny>, C<hide>, or C<show>. Limits are
evaluated in the order they're called. The last limit that applies will be the
one which takes effect. Regexes are matched against the class; strings are
fully L<qualified|/qualify> and used as an exact match against the class name.
The base set of restrictions (which is reset every request) is set in
L</reset>, and usually modified by the application's L<Jifty::Dispatcher> if
need be.

If you call:

    Jifty->api->deny  ( qr'Foo' );
    Jifty->api->allow ( qr'FooBar' );
    Jifty->api->deny  ( qr'FooBarDeleteTheWorld' );

..then:

    calls to MyApp::Action::Baz will succeed.
    calls to MyApp::Action::Foo will fail.
    calls to MyApp::Action::FooBar will pass.
    calls to MyApp::Action::TrueFoo will fail.
    calls to MyApp::Action::TrueFooBar will pass.
    calls to MyApp::Action::TrueFooBarDeleteTheWorld will fail.
    calls to MyApp::Action::FooBarDeleteTheWorld will fail.
