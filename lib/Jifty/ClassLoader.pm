=head1 NAME

Jifty::ClassLoader - Loads the application classes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Jifty::ClassLoader> loads all of the application's model and action
classes, generating classes on the fly for Collections of pre-existing
models.

=head2 new

Returns a new ClassLoader object.  Doing this installs a hook into
C<@INC> that allows L<Jifty::ClassLoader> to dynamically create
needed classes if they do not exist already.  This works because if
use/require encounters a blessed reference in C<@INC>, it will
invoke the INC method with the name of the module it is searching
for on the reference.

Takes one mandatory argument, C<base>, which should be the the
application's or a plugin's base path; all of the classes under this will be
automatically loaded.

L<Jifty::ClassLoader> objects are singletons per C<base>. If you call C<new>
and a class loader for the given base has already been initialized, this will
return a reference to that object rather than creating a new one.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my %args = @_;

    # Check to make sure this classloader hasn't been built yet and stop if so
    my @exist = grep {ref $_ eq $class and $_->{base} eq $args{base}} @INC;
    return $exist[0] if @exist;

    # It's a new one, build it
    my $self = bless {%args}, $class;
    push @INC, $self;
    return $self;
}

=head2 INC

The hook that is called when a module has been C<require>'d that
cannot be found on disk.  The following stub classes are
auto-generated the class loader. 

Here the "I<Application>" indicates the name of the application the class
loader is being applied to. However, this really just refers to the C<base>
argument passed to the constructor, so it could refer to a plugin class
or just about anything else.

=over

=item I<Application>

An empty application base class is created that doesn't provide any
methods or inherit from anything.

=item I<Application>::Action

An empty mixin class for all actions in your application.  Should
B<not> inherit from L<Jifty::Action>.

=item I<Application>::Action::I<[Verb]>I<[Something]>

If I<Application>::Model::I<Something> is a valid model class and I<Verb> is one of "Create", "Search", "Update", "Execute", or "Delete", then it creates a subclass of I<Application>::Action::Record::I<Verb>  Models can control which actions are generated by overriding L<Jifty::Record/autogenerate_action>.  See also L<Jifty::Record/is_private> and L<Jifty::Record/is_protected>.

=item I<Application>::Action::I<Something>

The class loader will search for a plugin I<Plugin> such that C<I<Plugin>::Action::I<Something>> exists. It will then create an empty class named I<Application>::Action::I<Something> that descends from I<Plugin>::Action::I<Something>.

This means that a plugin may be written to allow the application to override the default implementation used by the plugin as long as the plugin uses the application version of the class.

=item I<Application>::Action::Record::I<Something>

An empty class that descends from the matching Jifty class, Jifty::Action::Record::I<Something>. This is generally used to build application-specific descendants of L<Jifty::Action::Record::Create>, L<Jifty::Action::Record::Execute>, L<Jifty::Action::Record::Search>, L<Jifty::Action::Record::Update>, or L<Jifty::Action::Record::Delete>.

=item I<Application>::Bootstrap

An empty class that descends from L<Jifty::Bootstrap>.

=item I<Application>::Collection

An empty class that descends from L<Jifty::Collection> is created.

=item I<Application>::CurrentUser

An empty class that descends from L<Jifty::CurrentUser>.

=item I<Application>::Dispatcher

An empty class that descends from L<Jifty::Dispatcher>.

=item I<Application>::Event

An empty class that descends from L<Jifty::Event> is created.

=item I<Application>::Event::Model

An empty class that descents from L<Jifty::Event::Model> is created.

=item I<Application>::Event::Model::I<Something>

If I<Application>::Model::I<Something> is a valid model class, then it creates an empty descendant of I<Application>::Event::Model with the C<record_class> set to I<Application>::Model::I<Something>.

=item I<Application>::Handle

An empty class that descends from L<Jifty::Handle> is created.

=item I<Application>::Model::I<Something>

If C<I<Plugin>::Model::I<Something>> exists and is a model class, then it creates a subclass of it named C<I<Application>::Model::I<Something>> for the local application.

This allows an application to customize a model provided by a subclass (or choose not to). Plugins should be written to use the application's version.

=item I<Application>::Model::I<Something>Collection

If C<I<Application>::Model::I<Something>> is a valid model class, then
it creates a subclass of L<Jifty::Collection> whose C<record_class> is
C<I<Application>::Model::I<Something>>.

=item I<Application>::Notification

An empty class that descends from L<Jifty::Notification>.

=item I<Application>::Notification::I<Something>

The class loader will search for a plugin I<Plugin> such that I<Plugin>::Notification::I<Something> exists. It will then create an empty class named I<Application>::Notification::I<Something> that descends from I<Plugin>::Notification::I<Something>.

This allows an application to customize the email notification sent out by a plugin as long as the plugin defers to the application version of the class.

=item I<Application>::Record

An empty class that descends from L<Jifty::Record> is created.

=item I<Application>::Upgrade

An empty class that descends from L<Jifty::Upgrade>.

=item I<Application>::View

An empty class that descends from L<Jifty::View::Declare>.

=head2 require_classes_from_database

Jifty supports model classes that aren't files on disk but instead records
in your database. It's a little bit mind bending, but basically, you can
build an application entirely out of the database without ever writing a
line of code(*).

* As of early 2007, this forward looking statement is mostly a lie. But we're
working on it.

This method finds all database-backed models and instantiates jifty classes for
them it returns a list of class names of the models it created.

Accessor to the list of models this application has loaded.

In scalar context, returns a mutable array reference; in list context,
return the content of the array.

# otherwise the DESTROY block gets called *after* there's already a
# bogus entry in @INC

# Use of uninitialized value in require at /tmp/7730 line 9 during global destruction.

Returns true if the package was autogenerated by a classloader.

=cut

sub autogenerated {
    my $class = shift;
    my $classname = shift;
    return $AUTOGENERATED{$classname};
}

=head1 WRITING YOUR OWN CLASSES

If you require more functionality than is provided by the classes created by
ClassLoader (which you'll almost certainly need to do if you want an
application that does more than display a pretty Pony) then you should create a
class with the appropriate name and add your extra logic to it.

For example you will almost certainly want to write your own
dispatcher, so something like:

 package MyApp::Dispatcher;
 use Jifty::Dispatcher -base;

If you want to add some application specific behaviour to a model's
collection class, say for the User model, create F<UserCollection.pm>
in your applications Model directory.

 package MyApp::Model::UserCollection;
 use base 'MyApp::Collection';
