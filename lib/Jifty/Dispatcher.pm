Jifty::Dispatcher - The Jifty Dispatcher

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In B<MyApp::Dispatcher>:

    package MyApp::Dispatcher;
    use Jifty::Dispatcher -base;

    under ['blog', 'wiki'] => [
        run {
            default model => "MyApp::Model::\u$1"
        },
        on PUT 'entries/*' => run {
            set entry_id => $1;
            show '/display/entry';
        },
        on '*/*' => run {
            my ($page, $op) = ($1, $2);
            my $item = get('model')->load($page) or next_rule;

            set item => $item;
            set page => $page;
            set op   => $op;

            show "/display/$op";
        },
        on '*' => run { dispatch "$1/view" },
        on ''  => show '/display/list',
    ];
    under qr{logs/(\d+)} => [
        when { $1 > 100 } => show '/error',
        set model => 'MyApp::Model::Log',
        run { dispatch "/wiki/LogPage-$1" },
    ];
    # ... more rules ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Jifty::Dispatcher> takes requests for pages, walks through a
dispatch table, possibly running code or transforming the request
before finally handing off control to the templating system to display
the page the user requested or whatever else the system has decided to
display instead.

Generally, this is B<not> the place to be performing model and user
specific access control checks or updating your database based on what
the user has sent in. You want to do that in your model
classes. (Well, I<we> want you to do that, but you're free to ignore
our advice).

The Dispatcher runs rules in several stages:

=over

=item before

B<before> rules are run before Jifty evaluates actions. They're the
perfect place to enable or disable L<Jifty::Action>s using
L<Jifty::API/allow> and L<Jifty::API/deny> or to completely disallow
user access to private I<component> templates such as the F<_elements>
directory in a default Jifty application.  They're also the right way
to enable L<Jifty::LetMe> actions.

You can entirely stop processing with the C<redirect>, C<tangent> and
C<abort> directives, though L</after> rules will still run.

=item on

L<on> rules are run after Jifty evaluates actions, so they have full
access to the results actions users have performed. They're the right
place to set up view-specific objects or load up values for your
templates.

Dispatcher directives are evaluated in order until we get to either a
C<show>, C<redirect>, C<tangent> or C<abort>.

=item after

L<after> rules let you clean up after rendering your page. Delete your
cache files, write your transaction logs, whatever.

At this point, it's too late to C<show>, C<redirect>, C<tangent> or C<abort>
page display.

=back

C<Jifty::Dispatcher> is intended to replace all the F<autohandler>,
F<dhandler> and C<index.html> boilerplate code commonly found in Mason
applications, but there's nothing stopping you from using those
features in your application when they're more convenient.

Each directive's code block runs in its own scope, but all share a
common C<$Dispatcher> object.

=cut

=head1 Plugins and rule ordering

By default, L<Jifty::Plugin> dispatcher rules are added in the order
they are specified in the application's configuration file; that is,
after all the plugin dispatchers have run in order, then the
application's dispatcher runs.  It is possible to specify rules which
should be reordered with respect to this rule, however.  This is done
by using a variant on the C<before> and C<after> syntax:

    before plugin NAME =>
        RULE(S);
    
    after plugin NAME =>
        RULE(S);

    after app,
        RULE(S)

C<NAME> may either be a string, which must match the plugin name
exactly, or a regular expression, which is matched against the plugin
name.  The rule will be placed at the first boundary that it matches --
that is, given a C<before plugin qr/^Jifty::Plugin::Auth::/> and both
a C<Jifty::Plugin::Auth::Basic> and a C<Jifty::Plugin::Auth::Complex>,
the rules will be placed before the first.

C<after app> inserts the following C<RULES> after the application's
dispatcher rules, and is identical to, but hopefully clearer than,
C<< after plugin Jifty => RULES >>.

C<RULES> may either be a single C<before>, C<on>, C<under>, or
C<after> rule to change the ordering of, or an array reference of
rules to reorder.

=cut

=head1 Data your dispatch routines has access to

=head2 request

The current L<Jifty::Request> object.

=head2 $Dispatcher

The current dispatcher object.

=head2 get $arg

Return the argument value. 

=head1 Things your dispatch routine might do

=head2 under $match => $rule

Match against the current requested path.  If matched, set the current
context to the directory and process the rule.

The C<$rule> may be an array reference of more rules, a code reference, a
method name of your dispatcher class, or a fully qualified subroutine name.

All wildcards in the C<$match> string becomes capturing regex patterns.  You
can also pass in an array reference of matches, or a regex pattern.

The C<$match> string may be qualified with a HTTP method name or protocol, such as

=over

=item GET

=item POST

=item PUT

=item OPTIONS

=item DELETE

=item HEAD

=item HTTPS

=item HTTP

=back

=head2 on $match => $rule

Like C<under>, except it has to match the whole path instead of just the prefix.
Does not set current directory context for its rules.

=head2 before $match => $rule

Just like C<on>, except it runs I<before> actions are evaluated.

=head2 after $match => $rule

Just like C<on>, except it runs I<after> the page is rendered.


=head2 when {...} => $rule

Like C<under>, except using an user-supplied test condition.  You can stick 
any Perl you want inside the {...}; it's just an anonymous subroutine.

=head2 run {...}

Run a block of code unconditionally; all rules are allowed inside a C<run>
block, as well as user code.  You can think of the {...} as an anonymous 
subroutine.

=head2 stream {...}

Run a block of code unconditionally, which should return a coderef
that is a PSGI streamy response.

=head2 set $arg => $val

Adds an argument to what we're passing to our template, overriding 
any value the user sent or we've already set.

=head2 default $arg => $val

Adds an argument to what we're passing to our template,
but only if it is not defined currently.

=head2 del $arg

Deletes an argument we were passing to our template.

=head2 show $component

Display the presentation component.  If not specified, use the
request path as the default page.

=head2 dispatch $path

Dispatch again using $path as the request path, preserving args.

=head2 next_rule

Break out from the current C<run> block and go on the next rule.

=head2 last_rule

Break out from the current C<run> block and stop running rules in this stage.

=head2 abort $code

Abort the request; this skips straight to the cleanup stage.

If C<$code> is specified, it's used as the HTTP status code.

=head2 redirect $uri

Redirect to another URI.

=head2 tangent $uri

Take a continuation here, and tangent to another URI.

=head2 plugin

=head2 app

See L</Plugins and rule ordering>, above.

Jifty::Dispatcher is an L<Exporter>, that is, part of its role is to
blast a bunch of symbols into another package. In this case, that
other package is the dispatcher for your application.

You never call import directly. Just:

Actually do what your dispatcher does. For now, the right thing
to do is to put the following two lines first:

=head2 _handle_stage NAME, EXTRA_RULES

Handles the all rules in the stage named C<NAME>.  Additionally, any
other arguments passed after the stage C<NAME> are added to the end of
the rules for that stage.

This is the unit which calling L</last_rule> skips to the end of.

=head2 _handle_rule RULE

When handed a single rule in the form of a coderef, C<_handle_rule>, 
calls C<_do_run> on that rule and returns the result. When handed a 
rule that turns out to be an array of subrules, recursively calls
itself and evaluates the subrules in order.

=head2 already_run

Returns true if the code block has run once already in this request.
This can be useful for 'after' rules to ensure that they only run
once, even if there is a sub-dispatch which would cause it to run more
than once.  The idiom is:

=head2 _do_dispatch [PATH]

First, this routine runs all the C<before> dispatcher rules, then it runs
Jifty->web->handle_request(), then it runs all the main C<on> rules,
evaluating each one in turn.  If it gets through all the rules without
running an C<abort>, C<redirect> or C<show> directive, it C<shows>
the template originally requested.

Once it's done with that, it runs all the cleanup rules defined with C<after>.

=head2 _match CONDITION

Returns the regular expression matched if the current request fits
the condition defined by CONDITION. 

C<CONDITION> can be a regular expression, a "simple string" with shell
wildcard characters (C<*>, C<?>, C<#>, C<[]>, C<{}>) to match against,
or an arrayref or hashref of those. It should even be nestable.

Arrayref conditions represents alternatives: the match succeeds as soon
as the first match is found.

Hashref conditions are conjunctions: each non-empty hash key triggers a
separate C<_match_$keyname> call on the dispatcher object. For example, a
C<method> key would call C<_match_method> with its value to be matched against.
After each subcondition is tried (in lexicographical order) and succeeded,
the value associated with the C<''> key is matched again as the condition.

=head2 _compile_glob METAEXPRESSION

Private function.

Turns a metaexpression containing C<*>, C<?> and C<#> into a capturing regex pattern.

Also supports the non-capturing C<[]> and C<{}> notations.

The rules are:

=over 4

=item *

A C<*> between two C</> characters, or between a C</> and end of string,
should match one or more non-slash characters:

    /foo/*/bar
    /foo/*/
    /foo/*
    /*

=item *

All other C<*> can match zero or more non-slash characters: 

    /*bar
    /foo*bar
    *

=item *

Two stars (C<**>) can match zero or more characters, including slash:

    /**/bar
    /foo/**
    **

=item *

Consecutive C<?> marks are captured together:

    /foo???bar      # One capture for ???
    /foo??*         # Two captures, one for ?? and one for *

=item *

The C<#> character captures one or more digit characters.

=item *

Brackets such as C<[a-z]> denote character classes; they are not captured.

=item *

Braces such as C<{xxx,yyy}]> denote alternations; they are not captured.
