Jifty 0.70415
 * zh-tw L10N for authen/passwd/user plugins.
 * WWW::Mechanize 1.22 removed the form method.  
   thanks to hdp for noticing/poking
 * render_region should have default empty path.
 * Jifty::Plugin::REST::Dispatcher - Gugod pointed out that we don't need to
   stringify() the object-to-data output, because (esp for nested structures)
   it's far more convenient to have the $accept-specific formatter (e.g.
   YAML or JSON) to render it.
 * Added render_as_yui_menubar in Menu.pm
 * Upgraded YUI to 2.2.1
 * NOTICE: if you are using yui tabview, 
   please use tabview.css instead of tabs.css
 * Added yui/element-beta.js and yui/menu.js in Web.pm
 * Allow '->superuser' to be both an object and class method.
 * added audreyt's Doxory demo app from doc/talks/yapcasia2007-doxory.pdf
 *  Add doc and prefork dependency so the doc and dep tests pass
 * Preforking server support for Jifty::Server
 * Refactoring to support more template engines 
 * fix "open" class in menu - active menu item doesn't imply current open item
 * Jifty::Plugin - Authentication::Password now auto-loads LetMe and User.
 * added a "SkipAccessControl" framework directive
 * Doc: Add section on using models/actions outside of a Jifty app
 * fix handling of multi-line data when encoded in JSON -- they should never 
   wrap over multiple lines in generated output
 * helpers improvements for T::D
 * Make CurrentUser->new work as a method on an instance, so that 
   as_superuser works.
 * Added a 'None' session type for when your application doesn't need sessions
 * Can't just check to see if the config exists to decide whether to 
   initialze the Jifty object
 * Make render_region resolve relative template in current context.
 * We load the config on demand now, so it always exists. Test for 
   classloader existence, instead of config existence, to tell whether or 
   not we need to Jifty->new.
 * Refactor the I18N plugin stuff to not fail tests.
 * Make sure test coverage copes with new jifty->config 
 * Better plugin I18N
 * Plugin paths don't need to convert because File::ShareDir::module_dir
   always returns an absolute path. I have added also modification checking
   to the Jifty::I18N::refresh for plugin po files. -- Alexey Grebenschikov 
 * Log::Log4perl::Appender::String (used in tests) was only added in 1.02; 
   require at least that
 * Switch Jifty->config to automatic instantiation
 * Added a basic test stub for Jifty::Test::WWW::Mechanize. -sterling
 * don't require a bunch of unused modules that don't trickle to the templates
 * don't set the Home tab twice
 * use Pod::Simple::HTML where we need it
 * Administration and Online docs tabs are set in Jifty/Plugin/*/Dispatcher.pm
 * When running coverage, don't use Class::Accessor::Named as it uses 
   Hook::LexWrap
 * don't load up PodSimple and other friends unless you've actually enabled 
   AdminMode and brought OnlineDocs into the picture
 * Modified submit_html_ok to make it behave like the documentation says it 
   should.
 * Don't create a new config object every time we look at the db version
 * Added the ability to have a return button that looks like a submit button 
   on a form.
 * When you rest a lost password, email address is implicitly confirmed
 * extracted dump_rules into DumpDispatcher plugin -dpavlin
 * more quieting down of "couldn't drop that database that shouldn't have 
   existed in the first place" warnings
 * keep old LDAP and CAS plugins usable, 
   THIS COULD BREAK APP MODELS NAME 
   LDAPUser and CASUser models are now User -yves
 * Autogenerate Package::Action when we need it
 * Jifty: We now depend on Scalar::Defer 0.10 to not break the *_ 
   localization.
 * Jifty::DBI::Param::Schema - Mention how to use "defer".
 * Remove legacy naming from the Auth::Password plugin #  nelhage++ 
 * The plugin classloader is wrong. it's going away forever
 * LetMes need to deal with user objects as superuser to get their tokens
 * next major round of work on the login plugin. signup now works
   slightly better debug logging from the jifty dispatcher
 * Slightly better mail sending defaults
 * When we use App::Class, actually require the module, to save the user some 
   typing
 * Changes to the dispatching to templates:
 * only add '/index.html' to the path given if there is no template that can 
   handle the given path.
 * template_exists now checks for Template::Declare templates too
 * tests that check that T::D templates are preferred over Mason templates.
 * Set some svn:ignore properties so that generated files don't litter the 
   tree
 * Include the jifty skeleton app by default.
 * make the 'hey! it's admin mode' bit not overwrite the menu
 * TD fragments and unicode needed some massage.
 * Next pass at a login/signup password auth plugin. Now supports login and 
   logout and signup
 * Jifty::CurrentUser now has a default "_init" behaviour.
 * The password auth plugin now works
 * Updated the 'feeds' section in J:M::Cookbook to not lie about the way 
   XML::Feed actually works.  Arguably it /should/ work the way we described
   ("your implementation is showing"), but fixing the docs was easier than 
   submitting a patch to someone else's module.
 * Now we can inherit actions from plugins
 * fixed incorrect documentation of _ and added a SYNOPSIS
 * "final" Mergedown of the Template-Declare branch of Jifty.
  - New Template::Declare based templating system (optional)
  - Significant work on plugins
  - Significant refactoring
  - Many jifty features extracted to 'mandatory' plugin applets. 
    (These should be made optional or removable over time)
 * Doc patch for how to do multiple "onclick" actions - jpollack@gmail.com
 * Log::Log4perl::Appender::String (used in tests) was only added in
    1.02; require at least that
 * add doc to manage a superuser group
 * add doc to emulate updated_on
 * Add note to cookbook showing how to change other fields using ajax 
   canonicalization
 * Basic handler for running Jifty under mod_perl2.  Tested under Unbuntu
   Feisty, with a default Apache2/MP2 install.  Requires a config change,
   explained in the perldoc. -rodi
 * examples/{Chat,Clock,Ping}/: Use Jifty::Server::Fork instead of
   stub ::Server subclasses.
 * Jifty::Server::Fork - New module to conveniently express
   a forking builtin server.
 * Plugin templates should override the core, but not application templates
 * Since we use the schema tool to manage jifty's database, it's important 
   that it be able to be called from running code (including a DESTROY block).   As it was, we were initializing (reinitializing) Jifty from within the 
   DESTROY. That doesn't work so well.
 * Better test for "jifty already initted"
 * Fix adding columns during an upgrade.
 * added a Deploying page to the manual based on the process I have found 
   successful
 * updated the upgrading manual and added a few extra glossary items
 * DBD::pg passes postgres' warnings up, so try to convert their various
   logging levels back to Log4Perl levels.
   Completely heuristic, probably wants more guarding so it doesn't
   reach out and bite someone.
 * This quiets some of the most annoting warns revealed when I removed
   the log-level downing in Script/Schema.pm
 * Added support for schema_version() in records
 * Updated the schema upgrade process to handle renames more nicely
 * Added a simple test for upgrading
 * YAML.pm is currently required even if YAML::Syck is present.
   The Makefile now requires YAML even if you have a C compiler 
   and are installing YAML::Syck.
 * added a CUSTOMIZATION section to the Jifty::Action docs
 * upping require for IPC::PubSub to 0.23 due to use of disconnect
 * Disconnect PubSub before dropping the database
 * Solve copious global destruction warnings
 * send correct HTTP/1.1 headers for caching when running Jifty with 
   DevelMode: 0
 * Support POSTing to /=/model/Foo to create items without specifying a PK
 * lib/Jifty/Manual/TutorialRest.pod - quick overview of REST plugin
 * don't double warn.  Now that we stopped schema creation from suppressing 
   warnings this *shouldn't* be necesary
 * stop hiding messages/warns from the database during tests
 * default to only showing WARN and higher when running tests 
   (rather than our more normal INFO)
 * Added the ability to force arguments and path when rengering a region. 
   This lets developers force override something passed in via ajax or a 
   "sticky" value from a previous request.
 * Jifty::Script - Assume "jifty fastcgi" when we are running under cgi.
 * I18N and zh-* L10N for menu and halo.
 * fix JScript conditional compilation bug. Jifty.Utils.isMSIE works now.
 * strict, warnings, and redefinition warning avoidance for 
   J::Module::Pluggable.
 * Alternate implementation of Module::Pluggable::Object's _require method to 
   avoid a useless string eval.
 * Actually carp from within our log warning handler, to not swallow critical 
   debugging into
 * Jifty::Logger - Properly respect previous $SIG{__WARN__} handler
   if Log4Perl isn't yet initialized; that means we won't silently
   discard compile-time errors from our model classes, though they
   are still demoted as warnings.
 * Refactored Jifty::Script::Schema to use extracted column, table and db 
   manipulation routines
 * Extract the "load model related classes" logic in the class loader to its 
   own function
 * A new method provides a tantalizing glimpse of jifty's forthcoming "load 
   models from the database" support
 * Added table and column schema generation methods to Jifty::Record, based on   an extraction of Jifty::Script::Schema
 * Added "create db" and "drop db" methods to Jifty::Handle
 * Added the 'bootstrap' option to vanilla Jifty::CurrentUser. Now there's one   fewer cases where you need a custom CurrentUser class
 * Jifty::Util - Add a generate_uuid method and use it to generate 
   ApplicationUUID.
 * Jifty::Script::App - Make the generated Makefile.PL more canonical.
 * Jifty::Util - only requires ExtUtils::MM at request.
 * Jifty::Util - fixed the broken Win32 logic:
  - use ExtUtils::MM before calling MM->maybe_command
  - ignore the case of letters when comparing file names
 * Change all tests for the literal Driver string "SQLite"
   to a regex match to /SQLite/, in anticipation of fancy
   drivers such as SVK::SQLite.
 * enable UTF-8 flag awarness in JSON libraries to fix problem in validation
   of values during creating a record via the admin interface when column has
   valid values with unicode chars.
 * include iepngfix 1.0
 * add MIME type text/x-component for .htc file
 * howto document for iepngfix
 * Our fallback I18N handle needs to specify that it should autocreate keys 
   if they're not found
 * Jifty::I18N: Provide a default fallback lexicon class for "en"
   so Locale::Maketext won't clobber our $@ stack.
 * Jifty::I18N - Avoid naked eval{} that clobbers $@.
 * Jifty::Web - Add private accessor for _state_variables to
   avoid typo-prone ->{'state_variables'}.
 * REST: Implementation for PUT and DELETE on model items
 * Canonicalize/validate after typing and blurring, too
 * Modernization of model declarations for compatibility with new 
   Object::Declare based Jifty::DBI
 * updating to  'max_length' name for the parameter formerly known as 'length'
 * Jifty: Deprecate ->length in web form and param fields;
    write ->max_length instead.
 * Allow create, load_or_create and load_by_cols to be used as class methods.
 * REST: Show an action HTML form when rendering /=/action/App.Action.Foo as 
   HTML
 * Fix running actions (checking for allowed-ness was done wrong)
 * Cut down on a lot of the crap that we outputed and fix up structure
 * Make it possible to request XML from the URL like the other data formats
 * Show action params in any data format instead of just an HTML form
 * Only allow method calls if the "field" is actually a column
 * Force stringification so that we don't segfault trying to output blessed 
   references and what not
 * added the update method which reconstructs the locale
   handle (used by Jifty::Handler::handle_request) [Jifty::I18N]
 * &_(loc) now uses the global locale handle instead of
   the one set up during Jifty::I18N->new().  [Jifty::I18N]
 * Audrey's refresh method now always calls C<update>
  either directly or indirectly (via C<new>) [Jifty::I18N]
 * C<handle_request> now always calls
  Jifty::I18N->update directly or indirectly
  (via C<Jifty::I18N->refresh>) [Jifty::Handler]
 * Misc minor startup-time performance improvements
 * Only run onsubmit() if we have an onsubmit property
 * Support for controlling browser-based autocomplete on form fields
 * Fix how fake buttons submit forms -trs
 * Gotta double-quote keybinding labels if they have embedded newlines.
 * Warnings when a developer puts a "show" into a "before" or "after" 
   dispatcher rule.

     * Added an action to let the user change his/her password in the
       login plugin -yves
     * AuthLDAP plugins: minor doc and debian rules fix -yves
     * You can now run actions and get back arbitrary data formats from
       the REST dispatcher -nelhage
     * REST dispatcher cleanups. -jesse
     * First cut at XML webservices in the REST plugin -jesse
     * The first bit of major refactoring of the REST plugin. -jesse
     * we loves our ACLs, we do. The REST plugin was violating too much
       encapsuplation -jesse
     * Added Module::Install files for plugins EditInPlace and Login;
       some of them were in the MANIFEST but not the repository, so we
       were getting false warnings of missing files when running 'make
       distclean'. -jpeacock
     * Add license to Login plugin's Makefile.PL. NOTE: remember to
       increment the plugin's $VERSION strings before releasing to CPAN
       (else updates won't get installed). -jpeacock
     * test and debian updates for the LDAP plugin -yves
     * Usable AuthzLDAP Plugin, see man Jifty::Plugin::AuthzLDAP
       while thinking on new more generic Jifty::Plugin::Authz::XYZ , 
       Jifty::Plugin::Authentication:XYZ -yves
     * Login: Don't delete arguments that you don't know about /a priori/.  
       Don't display fields that shouldn't be displayed 
       (using the Unrendered attribute). -jpeacock
     * Duplicate code removed from the plugin classloader -jesse
     * Better handling of autocreated modules from plugins.
       Print debug statements when autogenerating packages. -jpeacock
     * reworking of Login plugin -jpeacock
     * Some CAS authentification plugins -yves

   Internals
     * Jifty.pm: Load I18N after plugins, but before the main
       classloader, so the main classes has access to _(). - audreyt
     * Removed support for Devel::Gladiator. It was very, very beta and
       caused server processes to end up as zombies -jesse
     * qw'' is just weird. Change all instances to qw(). -schwern
     * Jifty::Action::Record 'use'd DateManip but never uses it. -schwern
     * It also used UNIVERSAL::require but did all of its requires via
       Jifty::Util. -schwern
     * Yet another fix to the URI-from-env feature, fixes a failing test
       (reported by alexmv++). -gaal
     * Guessing request schemes from the environment is fragile, so make
       the fallback on BaseURL more reliable. -gaal
     * when inferring a scheme for the application, look at REQUEST_URI
       instead of assuming http://. Fixes tangent() on non-http:// apps.
       -gaal
     * Use Jifty->app_class whenever possible -alexmv
     * Code cleanups in Jifty/Subs.pm -alexmv
     * Fix for when Jifty->web->url is called with query parameters
       -alexmv
     * Added a Module::Pluggable subclass to get our own (somewhat
       improved) require behaviour -jesse
     * We were not properly removing blank values on record create -jesse
     * Better handling of current_user when used as a class method -jesse
     * use ApplicationClass, not Application Name in the login plugin
       -clkao
     * Add _is_readable in Jifty::Record, which means the record should
       bypass current_user_can in check_read_rights. -clkao
     * Add results_are_readable argument to collection to mark records
       with _is_readable. -clkao
     * Minor refactoring to enable non-cookie based session storage
       -jesse
     * Use Jifty->app_class to construct app-space class names. -clkao
     * Jifty::JSON - Turn on $ImplicitUnicode so unicode strings
       can be reliably serialized into .js and back.
       (This is crucial for e.g. JavaScript confirm hooks.) -audreyt
     * avoid warnings in LetMe -jesse
     * DateTime: DateManip can get confused if someone else calls Date_Init 
       earlier in the process.  Tell it "no, really, GMT please" -falcone
     * DateTime: we're always setting the timezone to the user's timezone, even if
       new is explicitly called with a timezone.  This breaks DateTime->from_epoch
       which wants data back in UTC -falcone
     * provide json webservices -audreyt && pmurias
     * Jifty::ClassLoader - Defining MyApp::Action::Record::* now works. -audreyt
     * Jifty.pm: Before we call Data::UUID->new, be sure to load it. -audreyt
     * Jifty::Param::Schema allows "hints are 'type stuff'" but our Model syntax
       uses 'are' to build an arrayref, so "hints are 'type stuff'" in a model would
       result in displaying ARRAY(0x123456).   -falcone
     * implement if-modified-since for static view handler. -clkao
     * Module::Pluggable does't include empty intermediate classes now -alexmv

   Web UI
     * Links and Form titles needed to be better escaped -jesse
     * Add delete option in admin view (for Jamalle - private joke) -yves
     * Jifty::Param - It's no longer a Jifty::Web::Form::Field subclass.
       -audreyt
     * Add the ability to send "notes" to users from your canonicalizer.
       This is separate from the warning and error spans used by the
       validator -falcone
     * validator.xml - allow us to update action data just by changing
       it. Without this you had to set ajax_canonicalizes on a field in
       order to change it and have it propagated back. --falcone
     * Some refactoring of form field rendering, and adding a focus =>
       argument to form fields to focus them on page load. -nelhage
     * Switch our implementation of autofocus to use behavior, rather
       than a custom onload event -jesse
     * Fix calendar div & IE select box problem -ishigaki
     * Do a slightly more generic dereferencing on the user object's
       friendly name in the sidebar -jesse
     * Fixing autocomplete so we render the autocomplete div *before
     * the javascript, so the JS can hook it. -nelhage
     * Remove useless check in buttonToLink to get a javascript
       performance boost. -hlb
     * Make render_messages sort on result moniker as well. -audreyt
     * Jifty::Response: Ensure consistent ordering from monikers.
       -audreyt
     * Hacked the yui calendar component to allow selection of out-of-month
       dates -jesse
     * Even more I18N+L10N, this time for admin crud pages and calendar.html -audreyt
     * adjusted the output format of render_preamble by removing a redundant space. -agentz
     * The "length" attribute Web::Form::Field now also means HTML "maxlength"
       in addition to "size". -audreyt
     * calendar.js - Fire off canonicalization/validation methods upon clicking a
       date. -audreyt
     * Update YUI to 0.12 and port local changes -trs
     * Administration manage model : 
       add sortable capabilities in header table
       bug fix in delete item
       begining of modularity
       other cosmetic changes
       silk icons, wai tags thanks to Jamalle -yves
     * Jifty::Web::Form::Field and ::Select - Label display was rendered using
       the latin1-biased escaping in HTML::Entities; switch to the proper UTF-8
       escaping in Jifty->web->escape. -audreyt
     * This helps passing xhtml validation.
       <input> cannot be direclty under <form>, there should be a
       block-level element in-between. -gugod
     * made wait-message look consistent in both firefox and IE -agentz
     * admin/model/dhandler: localization hooks added, page title added -agentz
     * add yui/tabview and its assets -hlb
     * Indicate mandatory fields visually -trs
     * Only emit mandatory field warnings with Ajax when the field starts with
       data. -trs
     * Close <li>s we open in the admin interface -alexmv
     * remove extra </div>s -gugod
     * upgrade yui library & add yui/container.js -hlb
     * Fix broken Jifty.Utils.isMSIE -trs
     * Fix buttonToLink to deal with normal, non-ajaxy buttons that we want to turn
       into links -trs
     * Use Jifty::JSON::objToJson to properly escape JS values (in particular
       single quotes in button labels were causing problems) -trs
     * Add a key_binding_label attribute so that key binding labels can be set
       independently of the normal label -trs

   Jifty Actions
     * Jifty::Action: Generate stable auto-monikers for actions based on
       the caller stack. -audreyt
     * Negative searching for Search actions -jesse
     * Added an option to search the contents of any text field to jifty
       search actions -nelhage
     * Jifty::Action::Record: Allow the same for user-generated param vs
       CRUD actions. -audreyt
     * Jifty::Action - Autoincrement the per-request stash counter for
       the case of looped action creation. -audreyt
     * Fixed 'mandatory' validation misbehavior -- 'mandatory' now
       handled correctly -wolftang
     * Jifty::Param::Schema: Allow partial override of superclass's
       PARAMS by simply declaring a sub "param" and fill them with the
       fields you'd override. -audreyt
     * Jifty::Web / Jifty::Action: Stickiness now works on autogenerated
       monikers. -audreyt
     * Modified Jifty::Action::Record::Update so that empty strings for integer and
       boolean columns will be interpreted as NULLs. This may break apps that
       assume that an empty value string will be a no-op. -jesse
     * Jifty::Action::Record::Search - Consider "float" and "double" fields
       as numeric for comparison.  Also consider "char" as textual. -audreyt
     * Allow a canonicalization note to be set, even if you don't change the 
       value of the action parameter - falcone
     * L10N for Action::Record::Search -audreyt
     * Jifty::Manual::Actions include example with available are defer { ... }
       syntax which doesn't work because ref on variables deferred with Scalar::Defer
       return 0 instead of ARRAY -dpavlin
     * Add an "(any)" label to Action::Record::Search when render as radio. -audreyt
     * Jifty::Action::Record - Support for "is autocompleted" annotation. -audreyt
     * Jifty::Action::Record::Search - "numeric" and "decimal" fields are also
       numeric. -audreyt
     * Jifty::Action::Record - "is autocompleted" choices should not consider
       null/empty fields. -audreyt
     * Action::Record::Search - When there is just one choice, don't bother
       displaying '(any)' for Radio. -audreyt
     * Jifty::Action::Record::Search - First cut at a _dwim field for numeric
       fields that supports > >= < <= == = != ! <> operators. -audreyt
     * Jifty::Action::Record - Autocompletion now lists only the parts
       that matches the user-input as prefix. -audreyt
     * Jifty::Action::Record::Search - Add _before/_since for dates, as well as
       the equivalent _ge and _le for numbers. -audreyt
     * Jifty::Action::Record::Search - Add hints to _dwim. -audreyt
     * Adding a note about canonicalizers being idempotent -nelhage
     * add max_length alias to fix Object::Declare and Jifty::Param::Schema
       not handling length properly -alexmv

   bin/jifty
     * Change Jifty::Util's probe of bin/jifty from -x to -r for poor
       people on filesystems that does not have a executable bit. (The
       maybe_command is still needed for the .bat case.) -audrety
     * Fix the bin/jifty detection logick: The .bat extension exists for
       MSWin32, cygwin and os2, so use MM->maybe_command for those three
       platforms. -audreyt
     * Also, the -e check is redundant after -x, and in Win32 we can use
       bin/jifty.bat alone without bin/jifty, so make the check respect
       that case. Reported by: Stephen@s-team -audreyt
     * bin/jifty covered sigterm in a way that could cause zombie processes
       under fastcgi -jesse
     * Be explicit about the paths we're creating -alexmv
     * Jifty::Script::Server - Remedy for the edge error case where var/
       is missing, which used to cause mysterious error messages. -audreyt

   Building apps
     * Small error string change to suggest looking for missing use lines
       in models where refer_to is used -bartb
     * Ongoing work to pass through Class::ReturnValue errors all the way
       from Jifty::DBI to the view layer -jesse
     * create scaffolding actions with the new Jifty::Param::Schema
       syntax --falcone
     * Jifty::Manual::Upgrading - Remove the now-obsoleted claim that one has
       to "use" model classes before renaming it. -audreyt
     * Jifty::Upgrade - rename() now works with SQLite too, woot! -audreyt

   Dependencies and installation
     * Makefile.PL typo. Spotted by David Adler -jesse
     * Files for debian packaging, now rather for actual cpan release
       than for svn. -yves
     * Update MANIFEST.SKIP and run 'make manifest' to ensure that new
       files get added properly. -jpeacock
     * Added a dependency on libextutils-command-perl to debian control
       file -bartb
     * Older DBI versions didn't provide the API we're using. (0.22 is
       known bad) -jesse
     * Remove PerlIO::gzip as a Jifty dependency. -audreyt
     * Older XML::Writer versions failed tests. Dependency bumped -
       Thanks to Jonathan Stowe -jesse
     * Reverting to dumping using YAML.pm *again*, because YAML::Syck
       generates XML that makes YAML segfault :/ -nelhage
     * Fixed missing dependency on Module::CoreList -- Thanks to Henry
       Baragar -jesse
     * Makefile.PL - Add dependency on Test::Base and Module::Refresh.
       Reported by: Andreas Koenig -audreyt
     * Makefile.PL - Bump JSON::Syck dependency to 0.15 to handle
       single quote + unicode strings. -audreyt
     * SQLite is required to test properly -jesse
     * debian packaging updates -yves
     * Skip html files when looking for dependencies. This may cause us to
       miss some modules used only from within mason, but it will stop falsely
       detecting lines that start with the word "use" in docs. -jesse
     * add Test::MockModule and Test::MockObject for J::W::F::F testing -agentz
     * made Test::MockModule and Test::MockObject optional by
       putting them into development dependency list -agentz
     * Makefile.PL: remove Test::HTTP::Server::Simple dependency when $^O eq
       'MSWin32' -ishigaki
     * debian packages : add libtest-mockobject-perl libtest-mockmodule-perl in
       recommands packages (for new snapshot on jiftysvn repository) -yves
     * cleaned up debian readme -bartb
     * Clean up MANIFEST (mostly sqlite files) -alexmv
     * hlb++ reported that we really want HTTP::Server::Simple 0.26+,
       not 0.20+, as 0.20 and 0.21's critical URI-path-processing
       bug makes us non utf8 friendly. -audreyt
     * Added Data::UUID to the Makefile.PL and made sure we use'd it in 
       Jifty.pm -kevinr

   Internationalization
     * The ubiquitous "There was an error completing the request. Please
       try again later.") error message should be localised. -audreyt
     * We now default the location of the jifty siteconfig file -jesse
     * For some reason, loc('') started spewing out PO metadata. This
       seems to be b0rkeness on the Locale::Maketext layer, but for now
       generalize the undef detection logic in Jifty::I18N to recognize
       that case. -audreyt
     * "You need to fill in this field" needs to be localized. -audreyt
     * Stopped the internationalization system from exploding if a plugin
       doesn't have a module_dir -alexmv
     * The internationalization system now extracts messages from
       TemplateRoot, not share. -clkao
     * Plugin internationalization and french po files -yves
     * Jifty::I18N: New ->refresh method so .po files are reloaded
       properly when DevelMode is on. -audreyt
     * Even more l10n on Jifty::Action::Record. -audreyt
     * jifty po shouldn't check/update files under .svn directories -ishigaki
     * zh_cn and zh_tw translations -audreyt
     * "jifty po": Ignore _svn/ directories (Win32), as well as foo~ files. -audreyt
     * L10N for the new Search action fields. -audreyt
     * update fr.po -yves
     * update zh_cn and zh_tw and use traditional characters in zh_tw -agentz
     * update german J::Manual::Tutorial_de to match english version's 
       changes -wolfgang
     * Jifty::Script::Po: shouldn't update other catalogs if we specify target
       language with -l -ishigaki

   Testing
     * Jifty::Test: canonpath-ed for Win32 -ishigaki
     * make sure to skip 04memcached.t if you don't have Cache::Memcached
       -ishigaki
     * skip all the live tests (that call 'start_ok') on Win32 -ishigaki
     * shut up warnings when tests have no plan (t/Continuations/03-gc.t)
       -ishigaki
     * Added Jifty::Test->web to allow using Jifty->web in tests without
       a bunch of scaffolding.
     * Converted search tests to using Jifty::Test->web -schwern
     * Basic compile and startup tests for the Chat sample -schwern
     * add tests for Jifty::Web::Form::Field's render methods -agentz
     * adjusted t/06-forms.t to skip related tests when
       these two modules are not installed. -agentz
     * fix t/TestApp-Plugin-REST/t/02-basic-use.t because ClassLoader
       creates 4 new actions -falcone
     * add tests for Jifty::Param::Schema -agentz
     * TODO tests attempting to test if we get ajax validation errors for
       mandatory values after the sticky_value has been deleted -trs

   Email notifications
     * When sending email notifications, encode the message body -clkao
     * MIME-encode notification subjects. -clkao
     * Content-transfer-encoding needs to be 8bit. -clkao
     * Don't set notification transfer_encoding to 8bit if it's actually
       multipart. -clkao

   Dispatcher
     * avoid undef warnings in the Dispatcher -jesse
     * Jifty::Dispatcher - Alternation in extended shell globbing syntax
       now admits zero characters as well:
       on 'foo{,.zip}'     # matches 'foo' and 'foo.zip' -audreyt
     * Jifty::Dispatcher - NUMBER SIGN (#) now captures one or more digit
       characters in the extended shellglob condition syntax.
       Suggested by: Sebastian Riedel -audreyt

Jifty 0.60912

Testing

 * force to use Jifty::TestServer on Win32, though both JTS and THSS doesn't work properly at the moment. 
 * Give a description for get_html_ok so that you know what URLs fail/succeed in test output
 * Small stylistic cleanup to t/01-dependencies
 * Honour coverage options.
 * make sure to remove remnant test db before we test (Jifty on Win32 fails to unlink them right now)
 * Add Jifty::Test->test_in_isolation
 * Document Jifty::Test->is_done.
 * Added Jifty::Test->is_passing and is_done
 * Basic SYNOPSIS for Jifty::Test as well as mentioning the Test::More passthrough.
 * Add Jifty::Test->teardown_mailbox to mirror setup_mailbox
 * use safer File::Spec->rel2abs for SubTest
 * TestServer: use File::Spec->rel2abs; it's safer than Cwd::abs_path which croaks
 * Jifty::Test->test_file() accepting and returning a list causes problems
   because people will try to do:  my $file = Jifty::Test->test_file($file) and
   it ain't gonna DWIM.
 * Mention Shell::Command and Jifty::Test->temp_file in the style guide.
 * Add Jifty::Test->test_file() to declare files created only for testing and
   which should be cleaned up.
 * Fixing tests when using JDBI::Record::Memcached and setting things in the database from test scripts
 * Added explicit tests for Jifty::Action::Redirect
 * Script for running client and server side combined code coverage.
 * Give a description for get_html_ok so that you know what URLs fail/succeed in test output
 * Ignore "fluff" errors in HTML validation since they cause non-W3C attributes like "autocomplete" to be warned about
 * Add html_ok method for checking the mech's current content so tests can use it while we retain control over Test::HTML::Lint

Models

 * jifty model --name now uses the new schema {} sub.
 * Made the display of a friendly string for picking a record from a list a lot more flexible. 
 * canonicalization wasn't being properly run on models before validation
 * Added Jifty::Filter::DateTime, a JDBI filter that promotes DateTime
   objects to Jifty::DateTime objects on read, setting the time zone
   appropriately.
 * Added a concept of "virtual" arguments to actions. These won't be passed on to Record classes, even if they're sumbitted. We use this for Password confirmation arguments, so that we don't pass password_confirm on to the database, which is kinda useless (and breaks the db ;)
 * Added a as_superuser method to Jifty::Record to make it easier for
 * code to briefly dodge around ACLs when needed.


Admin UI

 * __jifty/admin: use ->models reflection to build the nav bar.
 * Integer C<gt> or C<lt> searching.
 * Added substring search and date comparison to J::A::R::Search
 * Basic search in admin mode using Jifty::Action::Record::Search. Still buggy, especially UI-wise, but functional.
 * Initial version of Jifty::Action::Record::Search. It only supports
 * exact positive searches on fields at the moment.
 * There's no point in rendering confirm fields for passwords when we're
   viewing records in admin mode.
 * Don't create _gt and _lt search fields for magic _id refers_to fields.
 * Make the admin UI look slightly less crappy.
 * Make admin mode DTRT with columns that end in _id and refer to another model.

REST

 * REST Dispatcher: model list reflection
 * Basic placeholder for REST plugin tests
 * REST Dispatcher skeleton that actually works
* Jifty::Plugin::REST::Dispatcher - /=/action/ now works across HTML+HTTP.
* J::P::REST::Dispatcher - all GET model URLs work, with 404s.
* Jifty::Plugin::REST::Dispatcher - model fetch actually works!


Actions

 * No longer generating arguments on C<Jifty::Action::Record> for fields
   that C<refer_to> C<Jifty::DBI::Collection>s, since we can't do
   anything useful with them right now anyways.
 * Get the _confirm items on passwords to respect sort ordering
 * Debugging improvements to stop stupid developer mistakes like passing the wrong sort of object to a Jifty::Action::Record. 
 * Now we do proper escaping of values in select-one lists.
 * Canonicalise {onclick}{submit} using the accessor wrapper.
 * Only call moniker when {onclick}{submit} isa Jifty::Action.

Documentation

 * Wolfgang Kinkeldei: added a pod on models 
 * Patch from Todd Chapman to fix tutorial
 * The beginnings of a Jifty code style guide.
 * Jifty::Manual::Continuations: reflect tangent() in the manual.
 * Developer documentation for the Jifty::Web::Form::Field::* hierarchy.
 * Add "How do I Add Atom/RSS Feeds" to Cookbook.
 * Add a recipe about running fastcgi server, which, in fact, only points
   to 'jifty help fastcgi'.
 * lib/Jifty/Manual/FAQ.pod - a start on an FAQ
 * Standardizing on referring to share/web everywhere in the tutorial.
 * Todd Chapman noticed a typo in the docs about autocompleters
 * Tutorial patch from rindolf++
 * documented logger_component argument
 * Add a small bit of doc about creating your own classes that are normally created by J::ClassLoader
 * A start at some docs on upgrading, needs reviewing and some more examples
 

Perfomance and optimization

 * Don't try to lowercase session information on postgres
 * Don't bother with session when serving static files.
 * Don't need ExtUtils::MakeMaker in Jifty::Util.  This is about 7% of total compile time loading jifty.
 * Kill Jifty::Web::Menu circular references.
 * Transform actions in {onclick}{submit} to their monikers, to avoid
   circular references.

Javascript and HTML

 * Fix AJAX canonicalization of date fields
 * Some browsers don't like trailing commas in JS arrays and hashes.
 * You can now pass confirm => 'question?' to javascript hooks (i.e. onclick) and get a confirm dialog in the browser. This doesn't work without javascript yet.
 * Use a local copy of the icons in our calendar widget, rather than the version that yahoo points to on akamai
 * fix the unexpected behavior in context menu for IE users.
 * Fix bug that didn't allow calendar months to be changed
 * Show calendar widget on focus and hide it on blur
 * If we don't have XMLHttpRequest, fall back on page loads
 * More thorough normalization of the submit parameter to Javascript handlers
 * Accesskey support added to buttons and links. It just uses the same keys as our javascript key bindings.
 * A little more Element/Clickable refactoring, and implementing a
   C<disable> option to onclick handlers that toggles whether or not to
   disable form fields for an action.
 * We now write out state variables at the start of forms, instead of at the end. 
 * Moved "Dismiss" buttons on messages and errors into Behaviour, so they only show up in javascripty contexts where they'd be useful
 * Added the ability to support target attributes in menu items and clickables
 * IE doesn't support element.setAttribute("class", "foo"), so use element.className instead
 * Explicitly specify a radix of 10 (decimal) for the parseInt calls used in Yahoo's calendar widget when parsing the date to initially display
 * Don't attempt to disable hidden inputs, since this sometimes causes IE to die
 * Use our own "enter" handler to select the button to click, since Safari sometimes gets it wrong with complex fields
 * The setAttribute call doesn't work for "class" in IE
 * Fixing the calendar widget to create a new calendar every time, so
   that the calendar reflects any changes the user makes in the text
   field.
 * Support turning off autocomplete on a per-form basis.  We still need per-field, but that's for later.

Distribution

 * debian packaging files for jifty
 * Removed duplicated share/web (it was copied to lib/auto/Jifty)
 * CGI.pm 3.17 (and possibly earier) had a bug where regex metacharacters in
   the PATH_INFO would cause it to puke.  We now depend on CGI 3.19 which fixed
   that bug.
 * Update Module::Install to 0.64.  The important thing here is it gets us
   a fixed Module::AutoInstall which works when you run Makefile.PL from the
   command line without CPANPLUS installed.
 * Don't index the t directory
 * add "use Jifty::YAML" before all uses.
 * Moved some modules to feature sections in Makefile.PL, updated 01-dependencies.t to recognise recommends sections as well as requires
 * Win32 requires File::ShareDir 0.04
 * Removed Text::Autoformat dependency and usage.

Dispatcher

 * Dispatcher: Support tangent($url) as sugar for Jifty->web->tangent(url=>$url).
 * Dispatcher: Allow "**" in glob pattern to mean anychar including slash.
 * Dispatcher did not have a ->{cgi}, so ->method certainly could not
   work.  Use the env variable for now.
 * Jifty::Dispatcher: abort(404) now works as the doc promised.

Internals

 * Jifty->web->return in void context is now an immediate return.
 * Jifty::ClassLoader - Make Jifty::Handle a CL'ed module as well,
   so MyApp::Handle can implement scary magick of its own.
 * Don't blow up when trying to check if action mixins are autogenerated
 * Let's be better about not redirect-looping when calling continuations
   to paths that contain multibyte characters. This solution is a hack,
   but it's better than looping.
 * Fix placeholders on browser forward/back
 * Replace hard tabs with spaces for consistency
 * Jifty::Web::state_variables no longer prefixes keys with J:V- before
   returning them, and Clickables now serialize the *outgoing* state
   vars, instead of the previous request's.
 * When rendering a page region, mark actions as inactive, don't remove
   them, so that their arguments are available inside fragments.
 * If we receive an action's arguments, but it's not in J:ACTIONS, or
   we don't run it for some other reason, don't consider it to have
   failed for the purposes of stickiness.
 * moniker_for and action_form now behave more cleanly with forms which
   have no non-continuation fields other than their submit buttons.
 * No longer lose if you do a Jifty::Action::Redirect to the same page
   you're already on. Also, add the ability to force Web to redirect,
   even if it's to the current page.
 * Jifty.pm: Change all __PACKAGE__ to Jifty.
 * Jifty::ClassLoader: provide ->models accessor to list the model classes.
 * added Jifty::Request::clear_state_variables
 * Form::Clickable: Don't mix self accessors and args.
 * Refactor the constructors for Jifty::Web::Form::*, which takes initial
   hash and values to be overridden with accessors.
 
Internationalization

 * LetMes' escaping should be utf8 aware
 * Email addresses probably shouldn't ever be utf8, but using the utf8 escaper is more Right(tm)
 * Properly UTF-safeing Jifty::LetMe
 Sean E. Millichamp and clkao both pointed out that Locale::Maketext could choke on overloaded objects like DateTimes. This change makes sure that doesn't happen any more.
 * Locale::Maketext doesn't always do the right thing with user-generated strings. So let's do that for it.
 * Properly encode arguments when generating LetMe URLs.

Email

 * add UTF-8 charset to message body on notifications
 * added infrastructure to do mime mails
 * make Jifty notifications be UTF-8

Plugins

 * Jifty::Web::Session::ClientSide - Client-side sessions.
 * Added a ProfileBehaviour plugin to aid profiling Javascript
   Behaviours (see app_behaviour.js in the Jifty source for some more
   information)
 * Some Behaviour profiling UI fixes.
 * Removing profiling code from behaviour.js
 * Get the signup form in the login plugin to respect locally defined schema for the user class
 * Added information about the environment to the EmailErrors plugin
 * Making the Login plugin play nice with admin mode.
 * Plugin static roots should take precendence over jifty's


Win32

 * Win32 complains when you try to unlink open DB
0.60722

* Dispatcher fixes to deal with the better canonicalization we started doing in
   0.60707
* changed all instances of '/usr/bin/perl' to '/usr/bin/env perl'
* added a path option to Jifty::Web->url
* added url tests
* Jifty::Manual::Actions -- update the worldview to reflect the
  parameters/arguments concept split.
* Introduce aliases.  See Jifty::Param::Schema for the table.
* Declarative Jifty Parameters.
* See Jifty::Param and Jifty::Param::Schema for the new syntax.
* Also added dependencies for Jifty::Script::Deps and declarative parameters.
* Also updated test applications to use declarative parameters. 
* Adding the CSS browser selector trick from http://rafael.adm.br/css_browser_selector/ to Jifty
* After autocomplete, trigger a validation.
* Upping JSON::Syck version dependency. 0.14 fixes escaping in single-quoted strings.
* Add a tooltip to the dismiss link and hide the dotted border
* Trailing commas are not good for JS in Safari
* Let's not blow up if we have placeholders on an input without a form
* Don't fade autocomplete in and out, just show and hide it
* Not submitting placeholder values when we submit forms or AJAX
* Add the class before we set the text, so that it appears grayed-out, rather than appearing and *then* graying out
* Support multi-line placeholders
* textareas can have placeholders, too; Style them appropriately as well
* Adding support for placeholders, grayed-out text in form fields that is written in with JS and vanishes on focus
* Auto-accept cpan's wisdom about prompts (Jifty::Deps)
* 0th sketch at "jifty deps"
* packaging plan updates
* J::Web::redirect can take a Clickable as arg, so make goto do that, instead of passing a URL with parameters, which doesn't work right
* Proper port support on urls. Thanks to jpeacock.
*  Resolve inconsistent filenames vs packages (Plugins)
* Switched Jifty::Web::url to use uri.pm rather than "heuristics"
* Let's not blow up if an action has a result that's an unblessed reference.
* Don't upgrade the database versions with schema --print. I'm not sure
  if there's a good way to persuade JDBI to give us the SQL to print, so
  we're just spitting out a warning for now, but that's better than the
  old behavior.
* Stop notification from flipping out if you use a scalar as the To:
* basic smoke test for jifty's notifications 
* Only set active child on create if we have a request
* More serious failure message, and don't imply that it's necessarily the server's fault.
* update .po files
* Jifty::Dispatcher - there's no call_next, remove it from POD, fnord.
* Refactoring message rendering slightly
* Fix Jifty-Win32 by having canonicalize_path always returning
  /-separated paths, never \-separated paths.
* Let classes be set on menu items
* Adding a warning about our slow Rico.Corner.round
* Documenting how to write sane Behaviours that don't leak memory (leak
  less memory, probably) in IE and aren't dog-slow.
* Fix JS memory leak in IE
* Make jifty tests respect the current given @INC, so it doesn't
  use lib when you are supposed to use blib during make test.
* Make the subtest system less painful.
* Use Jifty::Script to invoke test server, so it doesn't depend on
  bin/jifty.
* Fix a Safari display bug
* Fix calendar positioning bug and make sure it works when the date field is within a relative or absolutely positioned element
* Test file for Jifty::Client
* First pass at a Jifty client module.
*  English orthography fixes.
* Trailing commas in Perl are good.  In Javascript, they aren't, and sometimes cause IE to barf (like this one).
*  Hide focus border
* Lowering the autocomplete delay
* first-pass editorial run over Continuations.pod.
* Sketchy sketchy handwavy descriptions of page region backend.
  Ramblings totally not expected to be interpretable.

* Mention webservices in Actions doc
* Double fallback goes the way of the dodo
* Continuation manual
* Set up the output API for mapping of request parameters (input API
  already existed)
* Change method of getting results out of response on continuation RETURN
* Fewer calls to ->arguments, though they might be cached already.
* Not all CurrentUser classes may have a "nobody"
* Jifty::Web::Form:Clickable - provide a bit more info on how to use
  the "returns" field.
* jifty-dispatcher.graffle that shows the dispatch chain.
* Nicer "server down" message
* Re-enable form inputs after failure
* toggleable page region clickables weren't doing the right thing when used in non-ajax mode
* Fix the validation and autocomplete race condition
* Skip nobody and superuser when we do notifications


060707

  * Minor build fixes

060706
  * SECURITY UPDATE: Previous versions of Jifty did not 
  protect users against a class of remote data access vulnerability. If an
  attacker knew the structure of your local filesystem and you were using 
  the "standalone" webserver in production, the attacker could gain read
  only access to local files. 
  
  We found this vulnerability on 6 July 2006 during an internal Security 
  scan. We've added new tests to ensure that these and other similar
  vulnerabilities don't recur.

  We recommend that ALL users of Jifty UPGRADE to 0.60706 IMMEDIATELY.


060616
  * The last CPAN release was broken. No real changes.

060615 (15 June 2006)

The following incompatible changes were made to Jifty. For a complete changelog,
please see the "Changes" file.

 * Removed the ActionBasePath and CurrentUserClass configuration
   variables.  This breaks backwards compatibility.

 * If you've overridden /_elements/javascript in your app, you'll want to 
   take a look at the new stock version to see what has changed.

 * The JS method document.getElementsBySelector() no longer exists.  Use 
   cssQuery() instead.

 * Jifty::Record now returns empty objects for related objects that can't be 
   loaded, rather than undef


 * The keybinding JS code is now a more proper library 
   (Jifty.KeyBindings) and less intrusive.  If you've overridden the 
   default /_elements/wrapper in your app, you'll want to make sure you get 
   rid of the keybinding javascript (see the stock wrapper).  Just include 
   <& /_elements/keybindings &> wherever you want the keybindings for a 
   page to appear.

 * This shouldn't be the cause of breakage, but the included rico.js is 
   no longer a stock Rico build.  See the comments at the top of the file 
   if you're interested.

 * 'last_rule' now aborts only the current stage -- thus, last_rule                         
   from a 'before' block will *NOT* prevent the RUN stage from happening!
   This is a *BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBILE CHANGE*, but fixes the dispatcher
   to agree with its docs.
 * 'abort' is the correct call to skip straight to the cleanup block.                       
 * This allows the edit in place plugin to 'claim' its path and                             
   protect it from access control in the app's 'before' blocks                                                                                                                              



0.60507 (7 May 2006)

  * Pod fixes from Eric Wilhelm
    lib/Jifty/Object.pm - removed incorrect '=for' directive
    lib/Jifty/Web/Form/Field.pm - removed incorrect '=for' directive
    lib/Jifty/Web/Form.pm - removed incorrect '=for' directive

  * Better failure messages on when schema upgrades with SQLite fail
    from Alex Vandiver

  * Be a little more explicit about SQLite's limitation, and a possible
    (painful) workaround

  * Update the inc tree to 0.62 for various fixes,
    in particular improved share_dir compatibility. --Audrey Tang

  * We were inconsistently using Jifty::Util::make_path as a
    subroutine. It's a class method.  This could break the stub
    generators and tutorial.  Thanks to Sean E. Millichamp

0.60505 - Cinco de Jifty! (5 May 2006)

  * Native support for times and timezones.

  * Bug fixes (Many contributors)

  * Documentation updates (Many contributors)

  * Win32 Support (Audrey Tang)

  * New Session layer based on Jifty instead of Apache::Session.
    Designed for AJAX and Continations (alexmv)

  * Jifty internal metadata store (The begining of an internal configuration
    management system (alexmv)

  * Form fields no longer automatically insert the field name by itself
    as a class.  Instead, the class has changed to "argument-<fieldname>"
	to avoid conflicts with generic class names (such as date).

  * Move allow and deny'ing of actions into Jifty::API; this breaks
    backwards compatibility.

  * Don't allow applications to be named "Jifty" by default.  They are
    forced to be named "JiftyApp" now, for namespace reasons.

  * Remove Jifty->web->actions method; you should be using
    Jifty::Form's actions method.

  * Beginning of localization support.

  * Notifications can now take a user object or an email address

  * "sort order for arguments" patch, as suggested by miyagawa.  This
    makes use of sort_order column property of Jifty::DBI

  * YAML -> Jifty::YAML

  * Switch from Time::ParseDate to Date::Manip, since the former isn't
    win32 compatible

  * Shuffle the Mason and static handlers into Jifty::View namespace

  * Jifty no longer attempts to AJAX submit file upload fields

  * We no longer write DefaultStaticRoot and DefaultTemplateRoot into
    config files

  * Added a "LogLevel" option to the Jifty config file, so you can
    more easily enable debug logging.


0.60321

  * 'return if already_run' in after rules so they run only once

  * Overhauled the static server to try really hard to force caching
    by clients.  It also gzips its content, if possible.

  * More stylish forms

  * Allow Jifty->web->return( to => "..default path..", ...)

  * Actually accept region names to refresh

  * Halo improvements

  * chromatic supplied a patch to switch from UNIVERSAL::isa to ->isa.

  * Trivial webservices hack

  * It's now possible to override Jifty::Record's baseclass in your
    app


0.60221

  * Use Jifty::Util->require to log require errors

  * Auto-generate Bootstrap class

  * Give us a way to get the CurrentUser from a Mech object during
    testing

  * When calling a continuation, try to make sure that the urls are
    really different, not just differently canonicalized, lest we get
    an infinite loop

  * Default to not showing debug logs

  * Fragments in JS land now know about their parents, and pass their
    superstructure in the fragment request.  This lets $region->parent
    have full information.

  * 'refresh => region' mode for replacement

  * Better docs on region replacement

  * add_* calls on Jifty::Request now return the object added, not the
    request


0.60213

  * Jifty::Dispatcher written

  * Jifty::Handler is now an object, not a utility. It has the power
    to "run" a request.

  * Call chain is now Handler to Dispatcher, which calls Jifty::Web
    and Mason, instead of the other way around.

  * Better Documentation coverage.

  * Paint on some really bitchin 'go faster' stripes on the server.

  * Refactored the dispatcher to use exceptions rather than LABELS: so
    that Devel::DProf doesn't fall over

  * Added a new "DevelMode" flag, to toggle the peformance-killing
    development aids.

  * Only drop tables if the tests all succeeded

  * Fragments now go through the dispatcher

  * `jifty schema` overhaul

  * Mandatory form fields now have a css marker.

  * Do away with setup_actions mason method

  * Stop using mason notes

  * Jifty::Script::Schema support for basic mysql love

  * lighttpd support.

  * Move autocomplete.xml and validator.xml to __jifty/.

  * Upgrade to Scriptaculous 1.5.1.

  * Delete is its own action now, instead of being part of Update.


0.51228

 * Jifty::Action->argument_names should sort keys lexographically, not
   random hash-ordering.

 * Remove last vestiges of ::Delete from ::Update

 * Refactored Jifty::Config to allow the application class to be
   specified when calling Config->guess

 * Refactored Jifty::Script::App into bite-sized morsels

 * Made Jifty::Script::App generate a config file

 * Made Jifty::Script::App and Jifty::Config::Guess happy with
   multi-level package names


0.51225 - Initial release
